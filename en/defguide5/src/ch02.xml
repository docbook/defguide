    </indexterm>This chapter explains in concrete, practical terms how to make
  DocBook documents. It’s an overview of all the kinds of markup that are
  possible in DocBook documents. It explains how to create several kinds of
  DocBook documents: books, sets of books, chapters, articles, and reference
  manual entries. The idea is to give you enough basic information to actually
  start writing. The information here is intentionally skeletal; you can find
  the details in the reference section of this book.</para>

        <secondary>XML documents</secondary>
      </indexterm>An <acronym>XML</acronym> document consists of an optional
    <acronym>XML</acronym> declaration, an optional Document Type Declaration,
    which includes an optional internal subset, and a document (or root)
    element. We’ll discuss each of these in turn.</para>

    <para>In <acronym>XML</acronym> vocabularies like DocBook, which are
    defined with RELAX NG (and also in the case of vocabularies defined with
    W3C’s <acronym>XML</acronym> Schema), it is common to omit the Document
    Type Declaration entirely. The Document Type Declaration associates a
    document with a particular Document Type Definition
    (<acronym>DTD</acronym>).</para>

          <secondary>XML, identifying</secondary>
        </indexterm><acronym>XML</acronym> documents often begin with an
      <acronym>XML</acronym> declaration that identifies a few simple aspects
      of the document, for example:</para>

      <screen>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</screen>

      <para>Identifying the version of <acronym>XML</acronym> ensures that
      future changes to the <acronym>XML</acronym> specification will not
      alter the semantics of this document. The encoding declaration tells the
      processor what character encoding this document uses. It must match the
      actual encoding that you use. The complete details of the
      <acronym>XML</acronym> declaration are described in the W3C standard,
      <citetitle>Extensible Markup Language (<acronym>XML</acronym>)
      1.0</citetitle> <biblioref linkend="XML"/>.</para>

      <para>If your document uses <acronym>XML</acronym> 1.0 and an encoding
      of either <literal role="encoding">utf-8</literal> or <literal role="encoding">utf-16</literal>, the <acronym>XML</acronym> declaration
      is not required. But it is never wrong to include it. If you do not
      include an <acronym>XML</acronym> declaration, your document must
      conform to <acronym>XML</acronym> 1.0. If you want to use
      <acronym>XML</acronym> 1.1, you must include an <acronym>XML</acronym>
      declaration and specify <code>version="1.1"</code> in it.</para>

      <para>The <acronym>XML</acronym> declaration is syntactically similar to
      a processing instruction, but it is not one. The <acronym>XML</acronym>
      declaration, if it is present, must be absolutely the first thing in
      your document and it may not appear anywhere else.</para>

      have almost always had one.</para>

        </indexterm>The Document Type Declaration identifies what the root

      <acronym>DTD</acronym> that should be used when parsing the document. A
      typical Document Type Declaration for a DocBook <acronym>V4.5</acronym>
      document looks like this:</para>

      <screen>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN"
               "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd"&gt;</screen>

          <primary>system identifiers</primary>

          <secondary>XML</secondary>
        </indexterm>This declaration indicates that the root element will be
      <tag>book</tag> and that the <acronym>DTD</acronym> used will be
      DocBook <acronym>V4.5</acronym>, identified with both its public and
      system identifiers. In this example, the <acronym>DTD</acronym> is
      identified with an <acronym>HTTP</acronym> <acronym>URI</acronym>.
      <indexterm>
          <primary>URI</primary>

          <secondary>XML system identifiers</secondary>
        </indexterm>System identifiers in <acronym>XML</acronym> must be
      <acronym>URI</acronym>s. Almost all systems accept filenames and
      interpret them locally as <literal>file:</literal>
      <acronym>URL</acronym>s, but it’s always correct to fully qualify
      them.</para>

      <para>You can specify a <acronym>DTD</acronym> for DocBook
      <acronym>V5.0</acronym> documents:</para>

      <screen>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V5.0//EN"
               "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/docbook.dtd"&gt;</screen>

      <para>But the limited constraints that can be expressed in
      <acronym>DTD</acronym>s mean that the resultant document may or may not
      <emphasis>really</emphasis> be valid DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>.
      The normative schema for DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> is the RELAX NG
      grammar with its Schematron annotations.</para>

      <para>The only reason to use a <acronym>DTD</acronym> with DocBook
      <acronym>V5.0</acronym> is if your editing environment (or other tool)
      requires one, for example, for syntax-directed editing. If you’re using
      a tool that requires <acronym>DTD</acronym>s, check with the vendor, as
      maybe a more recent version is available that supports RELAX NG.</para>

      <para>These declarations form what is known as the internal subset. In
      this example, the <acronym>DTD</acronym> has been omitted, but the two
      are not mutually exclusive. If you are using a <acronym>DTD</acronym>
      (which is technically known as the <firstterm>external
      subset</firstterm>), you can include the internal subset immediately
      after the <acronym>DTD</acronym>:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V5.0/EN"
               "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/docbook.dtd" [

        </indexterm>When both are specified, the internal subset is parsed
      <emphasis>first</emphasis>. If multiple declarations for an entity
      occur, the first declaration is used. This means that declarations in
      the internal subset override declarations in the external subset.</para>

        </indexterm>All <acronym>XML</acronym> documents must have exactly one

        <secondary>dividing</secondary>
      </indexterm>The rest of this chapter describes how you can break
    documents into logical chunks, such as books, chapters, sections, and so
    on. Before we begin, and while the subject of the internal subset is fresh
    in your mind, let’s take a quick look at how to break documents into
    separate files.</para>

    <para>Actually, we’ve already told you how to do it. If you recall, in the
    preceding sections we had declarations of the form:</para>

    <screen>&lt;!ENTITY <replaceable>name</replaceable> SYSTEM "<replaceable>filename</replaceable>"&gt;</screen>

    <para><indexterm>
        <primary>entities</primary>

        <secondary>inserting files</secondary>
      </indexterm>If you refer to the entity <replaceable>name</replaceable>
    in your document after this declaration, the system will insert the
    contents of the file <replaceable>filename</replaceable> into your
    document at that point. So, if you’ve got a book that consists of three
    chapters and two appendixes, you might create a file called
    <filename>book.xml</filename>, which looks like this:<indexterm>
        <primary>examples</primary>

        <secondary>book</secondary>
      </indexterm><indexterm>
        <primary>books</primary>

        <secondary>example</secondary>
      </indexterm></para>

    <screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE book [
&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM "chap2.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY chap3 SYSTEM "chap3.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY appa SYSTEM "appa.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY appb SYSTEM "appb.xml"&gt;
]&gt;
&lt;book xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My First Book&lt;/title&gt;
&amp;chap1;
&amp;chap2;
&amp;chap3;
&amp;appa;
&amp;appb;
&lt;/book&gt;</screen>

    <para><indexterm>
        <primary>Document Type Declaration</primary>

        <secondary>divisions of documents</secondary>
      </indexterm>You can then write the chapters and appendixes conveniently
    in separate files.</para>

    <para>Documents that you reference with external parsed entities cannot
    have a Document Type Declaration. For example, Chapter 1 might begin like
    this:</para>

    <screen>&lt;chapter xml:id="ch1"&gt;&lt;title&gt;My First Chapter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;para&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/para&gt;
…</screen>

    <para>But it must not begin with its own Document Type Declaration:</para>

    <screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE chapter&gt;
&lt;chapter xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
         xml:id="ch1"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My First Chapter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;para&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/para&gt;
…</screen>

    <para>It is also possible to construct documents from different files
    using XInclude. Recasting the previous example using XInclude
    yields:<indexterm>
        <primary>XInclude</primary>
      </indexterm><indexterm>
        <primary>examples</primary>

        <secondary>XInclude</secondary>
      </indexterm></para>

    <screen>&lt;book xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" version="5.0"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My First Book&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="chap1.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="chap2.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="chap3.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="appa.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="appb.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;</screen>

    <para>Notice that we can completely omit the Document Type Declaration in
    this case, but we must declare the XInclude namespace.<indexterm>
        <primary>namespaces</primary>

        <secondary>XInclude</secondary>
      </indexterm></para>

    <para>The essential trade-offs between external parsed entities and
    XInclude are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>XInclude can be used in a document that does not have a Document
        Type Declaration. Many web services applications (ones that rely on
        SOAP, anyway) forbid a Document Type Declaration and therefore cannot
        use entities of any sort.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The documents <emphasis>referenced by</emphasis> XInclude are
        complete, free-standing <acronym>XML</acronym> documents. They can
        declare their own local entities using a Document Type Declaration.
        Documents referenced by external parsed entities cannot have a
        Document Type Declaration. If they use entities, those entities must
        be declared in the document that does the including.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>External parsed entities can have multiple top-level elements.
        They are not required to be <quote>single rooted.</quote> XIncluded
        documents must be wholly well-formed <acronym>XML</acronym>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>All <acronym>XML</acronym> validators support external parsed
        entities. (Validators that do not <emphasis>are not</emphasis>
        conformant <acronym>XML</acronym> processors.) XInclude is a separate
        specification and may or may not be supported by tools.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <acronym>XML</acronym> validator expands entities and
        therefore <quote>sees</quote> the entire document. This means that
        ID/IDREF links can freely cross entity boundaries. Because XIncluded
        documents are free-standing, a document containing an IDREF that
        crosses a document boundary cannot be valid. It can be well-formed,
        and processors can do the right thing, but the validator cannot
        determine that the document is valid. What’s more, the same ID value
        can occur in several XIncluded documents without causing a validity
        error. This may cause subsequent processing to fail.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>As time passes, the use of <acronym>DTD</acronym>-based
        mechanisms like entities is diminishing. If you have an eye on the
        future, to the extent that it is practical, it is probably better to
        use XInclude than entities.<indexterm class="endofrange" startref="idx.entities-2"/><indexterm class="endofrange" startref="idx.entities-1"/></para>

        </indexterm>A <tag>book</tag> is probably the most common
      top-level element in a document. The DocBook definition of a book is
      very loose and general. Given the variety of books authored with DocBook
      and the number of different conventions for book organization used
      around the world, any attempt to impose a strict ordering of elements
      would make the content model extremely complex. Therefore, DocBook gives
      you free rein. You can use a local customization (see <xref linkend="app-customizing"/>) if you want to impose a more strict
      ordering for your applications.</para>

            <para>The <tag>sect1</tag>…<tag>sect5</tag>
            elements are sectioning elements. They can occur in most <phrase role="keep-together">component-level</phrase> elements. These
            numbered section elements must be properly nested
            (<tag>sect2</tag>s can only occur inside
            <tag>sect1</tag>s, <tag>sect3</tag>s can only
            occur inside <tag>sect2</tag>s, and so on). There are five

            alternative to numbered sections. The <tag>section</tag>
            element is recursive, meaning that you can nest it to any depth
            desired.</para>

            <tag>simplesect</tag> element. It is a terminal section
            that can occur at any level, but it cannot have any other
            sectioning element nested within it.</para>

            <para>A distinguishing feature of <tag>simplesect</tag> is

      and sectioning elements. These are the (roughly) paragraph-level
      elements in DocBook. They can be divided into a number of categories:
      lists, admonitions, line-specific environments, synopses of several
      sorts, tables, figures, examples, and a dozen or more miscellaneous
      elements.</para>

        elements into two classes, <firstterm>block</firstterm> and
        <firstterm>inline</firstterm>. From a structural point of view, this
        distinction is based loosely on their relative size, but it’s easiest
        to describe the difference in terms of their presentation.</para>

        elements, and many can contain character data and inline elements.
        Paragraphs, lists, sidebars, tables, and block quotations are all
        common examples of block elements.</para>

        obvious breaks. The most common distinguishing mark of inline elements
        is a font change, but inline elements may present no visual
        distinction at all. Inline elements contain character data and
        possibly other inline elements, but they never contain block elements.
        Inline elements are used to mark up data such as cross-references,
        filenames, commands, options, subscripts and superscripts, and
        glossary terms.</para>

          <secondary>inline elements</secondary>
        </indexterm>Users of DocBook are provided with a surfeit of inline
      elements. Inline elements are used to mark up running text. In published
      documents, inline elements often cause a font change or other small
      change, but they do not cause line or paragraph breaks.</para>

      <para>In practice, writers generally settle on the tagging of inline
      elements that suits their time and subject matter. This may be a large
      number of elements or only a handful. What is important is that you
      choose to mark up not every possible item, but only those for which
      distinctive tagging will be useful in the production of the finished
      document for the readers who will search through it.</para>

      <para>The following comprehensive list may be a useful tool for the
      process of narrowing down the elements that you will choose to mark up;
      it is not intended to overwhelm you by its sheer length. For
      convenience, we’ve divided the inlines into several <phrase role="keep-together">subcategories</phrase>.</para>

      <para>The classification used here is not meant to be authoritative,
      only helpful in providing a feel for the nature of the inlines. Several
      elements appear in more than one category, and arguments could be made
      to support the placement of additional elements in other categories or
      entirely new categories.</para>

  <section xml:id="roots"><info><title>Roots: Starting Your DocBook Document</title></info>
    

    <para>There’s one final detail of the physical and logical structures of
    DocBook that we’ve left out: where can your document begin? In other
    words, what are the valid <quote>document elements</quote> of DocBook
    documents? Naturally, you can start at <tag>set</tag> and
    <tag>book</tag>, but can you also start at
    <tag>chapter</tag>? What about <tag>para</tag> or
    <tag>personname</tag>?</para>

    <para>If you come to DocBook from the <acronym>DTD</acronym> days, this
    question may seem odd. A <acronym>DTD</acronym> doesn’t provide any
    facility to impose constraints on where a document can begin. If the
    element occurs in the <acronym>DTD</acronym>, you can start with
    it.</para>

    <para>RELAX NG does give us the ability to impose such constraints. In
    fact, it <emphasis>requires</emphasis> that we do. Of course, we could
    make the constraint vacuous by listing every possible element as a
    potential document element.</para>

    <para>But, on reflection, that’s not necessarily the best choice. It’s
    valuable to have metadata associated with documents, so only elements with
    an <tag>info</tag> element can be root elements, but not every
    element with an <tag>info</tag> element is currently included. In
    DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> the following elements are available:
    <tag>acknowledgements</tag>, <tag>appendix</tag>,
    <tag>article</tag>, <tag role="keep-together">bibliography</tag>, <tag>book</tag>,
    <tag>chapter</tag>, <tag>colophon</tag>,

    <para>With the next point release of DocBook, <acronym>V5.1</acronym>, the
    technical committee may take the position that any element that can
    contain an <tag>info</tag> wrapper can be a document <phrase role="keep-together">element</phrase>. This would dramatically expand the
    list of valid root elements.</para>

    <quote>manpage</quote> concept. (We use the word <quote>page</quote>
    loosely here to mean a document of variable length containing reference
    material on a specific topic.) DocBook is rich in markup tailored for such
    documents, which often vary greatly in content, however well structured
    they may be. To reflect both the structure and the variability of such
    texts, DocBook specifies that reference pages have a strict sequence of

    bibliographies, and tables of contents. In many cases, these components

        <secondary>back matter, books and articles</secondary>
      </indexterm>Some forms of back matter, such as indexes and glossaries,
    usually require additional markup <emphasis>in the document</emphasis> to
    make generation by an application possible. Bibliographies are usually
    composed by hand like the rest of your text, unless you are automatically
    selecting bibliographic entries out of some larger database. Our principal
    concern here is to acquaint you with the kind of markup you need to
    include in your documents if you want to construct these
    components.</para>

    <para>Front matter, like the table of contents, is almost always generated

        </indexterm>In some highly structured documents such as reference
      manuals, you can automate the whole process of generating an index
      successfully without altering or adding to the original source. You can
      design a processing application to select the information and compile it
      into an adequate index. But this is rare.</para>

      <para>In most cases—and even in the case of some reference manuals—a
      useful index still requires human intervention to mark occurrences of
      words or concepts that will appear in the text of the index.</para>

          </indexterm>DocBook distinguishes two kinds of index markers: those
        that are singular and result in a single page entry in the index
        itself, and those that are multiple and refer to a range of
        pages.</para>

        <para>You put a singular index marker where the subject it refers to
        actually occurs in your text:<indexterm>

          </indexterm><indexterm>
            <primary>tertiary level index entries</primary>
          </indexterm>This index term has two levels,
        <tag>primary</tag> and <tag>secondary</tag>. They
        correspond to an increasing amount of indented text in the resultant
        index. DocBook allows for three levels of index terms, with the third
        labeled <tag>tertiary</tag>.</para>

        <para><indexterm>

          </indexterm><indexterm>
            <primary>ending index terms (ranges)</primary>
          </indexterm>There are two ways that you can index a range of text.
        The first is to put index marks at both the beginning and end of the
        discussion. The mark at the beginning asserts that it is the start of
        a range, and the mark at the end refers back to the beginning. In this
        way, the processing application can determine what range of text is
        indexed. Here’s the previous tiger example recast as starting and
        ending index terms:<indexterm>
            <primary>examples</primary>

            <secondary>indexing</secondary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <programlisting>&lt;para&gt;
  &lt;indexterm xml:id="tiger-desc" class="startofrange"&gt;
  &lt;primary&gt;Big Cats&lt;/primary&gt;
  &lt;secondary&gt;Tigers&lt;/secondary&gt;&lt;/indexterm&gt;

So much for tigers&lt;indexterm startref="tiger-desc" class="endofrange"/&gt;.
Let's talk about leopards.  
&lt;/para&gt;</programlisting>

          </indexterm><indexterm>
            <primary>class attribute</primary>

            <secondary>index entries, ranges</secondary>
          </indexterm>Note that the mark at the start of the range identifies
        itself as the start of a range with the <tag class="attribute">class</tag> attribute, and provides an <tag class="attribute">xml:id</tag>. The mark at the end of the range
        points back to the start.</para>

          </indexterm><indexterm>
            <primary>zone attribute (indexterm)</primary>
          </indexterm>Another way to mark up a range of text is to specify
        that the entire content of an element, such as a chapter or section,
        is the complete range. In this case, all you need is for the index
        term to point to the <tag class="attribute">xml:id</tag> of
        the element that contains the content in question. The <tag class="attribute">zone</tag> attribute of
        <tag>indexterm</tag> provides this functionality.</para>

        <para>One of the interesting features of this method is that the
        actual index marks do not have to occur anywhere near the text being
        indexed. It is possible to collect all of them together, for example,
        in one file, but it is not invalid to have the index marker occur near
        the element it indexes.</para>

        <para>Suppose the discussion of tigers in your document comprises a
        whole text object (such as a <tag class="element">sect1</tag>
        or a <tag class="element">chapter</tag>) with an <tag class="attribute">xml:id</tag> value of
        <literal>tiger-desc</literal>. You can put the following tag anywhere
        in your document to index that range of text:<indexterm>
            <primary>examples</primary>

            <secondary>indexing</secondary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <programlisting>&lt;indexterm zone="tiger-desc"&gt;
&lt;primary&gt;Big Cats&lt;/primary&gt;
&lt;secondary&gt;Tigers&lt;/secondary&gt;&lt;/indexterm&gt;</programlisting>

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>see and see also index entries</primary>
          </indexterm>DocBook also contains markup for index hits that point
        to other index hits (e.g., “See Cats, big” or “See also Lions”). See
        the reference pages for <tag>see</tag> and
        <tag>seealso</tag>.<indexterm class="endofrange" startref="idx.makeindex"/></para>

            <secondary>printing</secondary>
          </indexterm>After you have added the appropriate markup to your
        document, an external application can use this information to build an
        index. The resultant index must have <phrase role="keep-together">information</phrase> about the page numbers on
        which the concepts appear. It’s usually the document formatter that
        builds the index. In this case, it may never be instantiated in
        <phrase role="keep-together">DocBook</phrase>.</para>

          </indexterm>However, there are applications that can produce an
        index marked up in DocBook. The following example includes some one-
        and two-level <tag class="element">indexentry</tag> elements
        (which correspond to the primary and secondary levels in the
        <tag>indexterm</tag>s themselves) that begin with the letter
        D:</para>

        </indexterm>A <tag>glossary</tag>, like a
      <tag>bibliography</tag>, is often constructed by hand. However,
      some applications are capable of building a skeletal index from glossary

          <secondary>linking</secondary>
        </indexterm>To enable automatic glossary generation, or simply
      automatic linking from glossary terms in the text to glossary entries,
      you must add markup to your documents. In the text, you mark up a term
      for compilation later with the inline <tag>glossterm</tag> tag.
      This tag can have a <tag class="attribute">linkend</tag>
      attribute whose value is the ID of the actual entry in the
      glossary.<footnote>
          <para>Some formatters are able to establish the link by examining
          the content of the terms and the glossary. In that case, the author
          does not need to make explicit links.</para>
        </footnote></para>

      <para>For instance, if you have this markup in your document:</para>

  &lt;/glossdiv&gt;
⋮
&lt;/glossary&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Note that the <tag class="element">glossterm</tag> tag
      reappears in the glossary to mark up the term and distinguish it from
      its definition within the <tag class="element">glossentry</tag>.
      The <tag class="attribute">xml:id</tag> that the <tag class="element">glossentry</tag> referenced in the text is the
      <acronym>ID</acronym> of the <tag class="element">glossentry</tag> in the <tag>glossary</tag>
      itself. You can use the link between source and glossary to create a
      link in electronic formats, as we have done with the HTML and PDF forms
      of the glossary in this book.</para>

      <para>You can use the <tag class="attribute">baseform</tag>
      attribute on <tag>glossterm</tag> and
      <tag>firstterm</tag> when the term marked up in context is in a
      different form, for example, plural. Here is an example:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;para&gt;
  Using &lt;glossterm baseform="DTD"&gt;DTDs&lt;/glossterm&gt; can

      wrap your entry in the <tag>biblioentry</tag> element and mark
      up each item individually. The processor determines the display order
      and <phrase role="keep-together">supplies</phrase> punctuation. When you

      punctuation.</para>

      <para>Here’s an example of a raw bibliographical item, wrapped in the

      <para>The <quote>raw</quote> data in a <tag class="element">biblioentry</tag> is comprehensive to a fault—there
      are enough fields to suit a host of different bibliographical styles,
      and that is the point. An abundance of data requires processing

      <para>Clearly, these two ways of marking up bibliographical entries are
      suited to different circumstances. You should use one or the other for
      your bibliography, not both. Strictly speaking, mingling the raw and the
      cooked may be <quote>kosher</quote> as far as the schema is concerned,
      but it will almost certainly cause problems for most processing
