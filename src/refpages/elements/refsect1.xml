<refsection condition="ref.description">
<title>Description</title><para>Reference pages have their own hierarchical structure. A
      <tag>refsect1</tag> is a major division in a
      <tag>refentry</tag>, analogous to a <tag>sect1</tag>
      elsewhere in the document.</para>

      <para>The value of a separate hierarchical structure is that it allows
      the content model of sections in reference pages to be customized
      differently than the content model of sections outside. For example,
      because of this split, it was easy to add a recursive sectioning element
      (<tag>section</tag>) as a peer to <tag>sect1</tag> in
      DocBook <acronym>V3.1</acronym> without introducing it to <tag role="keep-together">refentry</tag>s, in which it would not be
      desirable.</para>

        <para>Formatted as a displayed block.</para>

        <para>In some environments, the name, number, and order of major
        divisions in a reference page are strictly defined by house style. For
        example, one style requires that the first major section after the
        synopsis be the <quote>Description,</quote> which it must have as its
        title.</para>

        <para>In those cases, it may be useful to replace
        <tag>refsect1</tag> in the content model with a set of named
        sections (following the pattern of <tag>refnamediv</tag> and
        <tag>refsynopsisdiv</tag>).</para>

        <para>Formatting reference pages may require a fairly sophisticated
        processing system. Much of the meta-information about a reference page
        (its name, type, purpose, title, and classification) is stored in
        wrappers near the beginning of the <tag>refentry</tag>.</para>

        <para>Common presentational features, such as titles and running
        headers, may require data from several of these wrappers plus some
        generated text. Other formatting often requires that these elements be
        reordered.</para>
