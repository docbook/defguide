<para>The <tag>webpage</tag> element is the root element of the
Website customization. Each <tag>webpage</tag> represents a single web
page. The expectation is that it will be rendered to a single HTML
page.</para>

<para>DocBook books, articles, etc. can be rendered either in print or
on the web in straightforward ways. Itâ€™s possible to render such
narrative content in less linear forms on the web, but often requires
extensive conventions about names or IDs of pieces. The goal of
Website was to make it easier to author in DocBook for content that
was designed to be rendered on the web in a less linear way.</para>
