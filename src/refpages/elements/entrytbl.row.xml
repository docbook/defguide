<title>Description</title><para>A <tag>row</tag> is a row in a table. It contains all of
      the cells (<tag>entry</tag>s or <tag>entrytbl</tag>s)
      that appear in that row.</para>

      <refsection><info><title>Processing expectations</title></info>
        

        <para>This element is expected to obey the semantics of the
        <citetitle>CALS Table Model Document Type Definition</citetitle>
        <biblioref linkend="calsdtd"/>.</para>

        <para>Within a <tag>row</tag>, cells are arranged horizontally
        from the start of the row to the end. Cells can, but are not required
        to, specify the column in which they occur, so it is possible for a
        row to contain fewer cells than there are columns in the table. This
        introduces missing cells, which are assumed to be empty. These missing
        cells can occur anywhere in the row.</para>

        <para>Once a cell has been allocated to a column, subsequent cells may
        not fill preceding columns. In other words, while three cells can
        specify that they occur in columns 1, 3, and 5, they cannot specify
        that they occur in columns 1, 5, and 3. Once a column is passed, you
        can never go back.</para>

        <para>If cells do not specify the column in which they occur, they are
        placed in the next available column. Calculation of the next available
        column is complicated by horizontal and vertical spanning. Cells from
        preceding rows can have a vertical span that causes them to extend
        into the current row, thus occupying space in the current row. These
        logically occupied cells are skipped when looking for the next
        available column. <phrase role="keep-together">Similarly</phrase>, if
        a cell has a horizontal span, it logically occupies the columns that
        follow it. Cells can simultaneously span rows and columns.</para>

        <para>Each of the following conditions is an error:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>A cell spans beyond the boundaries of the table.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A row contains more cells than there are columns in the
            table.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The arrangement of cells in a row forces one or more cells
            past the last column of the table.</para>
