<refsection condition="ref.description">
<title>Description</title><para>The <tag>title</tag> element is widely used in DocBook. It
      identifies the titles of documents and parts of documents, and is the
      required caption on formal objects. It is also allowed as an optional
      title or caption on many additional block elements.</para>

      <refsection xml:id="dbreproc.title"><info><title>Processing expectations</title></info>
        

        <para>Formatted as a displayed block. Titles are often repeated in
        several locations: for example, at the location where the object
        occurs, in the table of contents, and in running headers and
        footers.</para>

        <para>DocBook does not offer any mechanism for indicating where a line
        break should occur in long titles. Titles are often repeated and no
        single line break is likely to be correct in all of the places where a
        title is used. Instead, you will have to rely on your processing
        system to provide a mechanism, such as a processing instruction, for
        identifying the location of forced line breaks.</para>
