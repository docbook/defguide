<title>Description</title>

<para>An <tag>indexterm</tag> identifies text that is to be placed in
the index. In the simplest case, <phrase role="keep-together">the
placement</phrase> of the <tag>indexterm</tag> in the document
identifies the location of the term in the text. In other words, the
<tag>indexterm</tag> is placed in the flow of the document where
<phrase conformance="inschema">the <tag>indexentry</tag> in
</phrase>the <tag>index</tag> should point. In other cases, attributes
on <tag>indexterm</tag> are used to identify the location of the term
in the text.</para>

<para>An <tag>indexterm</tag> marks either a single point in the
document or a range. A single point is marked with an
<tag>indexterm</tag> placed in the text at the point of reference.
There are two ways to identify a range of text:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Place an <tag>indexterm</tag> at the beginning of the range with
<tag class="attribute">class</tag> set to <tag
class="attvalue">startofrange</tag> and give this term an <tag
class="attribute">xml:id</tag>. Place another <tag>indexterm</tag> at
the end of the range with <tag class="attribute">startref</tag>
pointing to the <tag class="attribute">xml:id</tag> of the starting
<tag>indexterm</tag>. This second <tag>indexterm</tag> must be
empty.</para>

<para>The advantage of this method is that the range can span
unbalanced element boundaries. (For example, a range could span from
the middle of one paragraph to the middle of the next.)</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Place the <tag>indexterm</tag> anywhere you like and point to
the element that contains the range of text you wish to index with the
<tag class="attribute">zone</tag> attribute on the
<tag>indexterm</tag>. Note that <tag class="attribute">zone</tag> is
defined as <literal>IDREFS</literal>, so a single <tag>indexterm</tag>
can point to multiple ranges.</para>

<para>The advantage of this method is that <tag>indexterm</tag>s can
be collected together or even stored totally outside the flow of the
document (e.g., in the <tag>info</tag>).</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<important role="fu">
<para>The common linking attributes will be removed from
<tag>indexterm</tag> in DocBook V6.0. They are inappropriate for
an index term.
</para>

<refsection>
<title>Processing expectations</title>

<para>The <tag>indexterm</tag>s are suppressed in the primary text
flow, although they contribute to the population of an index and serve
as anchors for cross-references. Under no circumstances is the actual
content of <tag>indexterm</tag> rendered in the primary flow. For
example, consider:</para>

<example xml:id="indexterm-example">
<title>Example index terms</title>

<programlisting>&lt;para&gt;USB&lt;indexterm&gt;
&lt;primary&gt;USB&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;see&gt;Universal Serial Bus&lt;/see&gt;
&lt;/indexterm&gt;&lt;indexterm&gt;
&lt;primary&gt;Universal Serial Bus&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;/indexterm&gt;
and Firewire&lt;indexterm&gt;&lt;primary&gt;Firewire&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;/indexterm&gt; are
common interface technologies for external hard drives, although
eSATA&lt;indexterm&gt;&lt;primary&gt;eSATA&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;seealso&gt;Serial ATA&lt;/seealso&gt;
&lt;/indexterm&gt; is also used.&lt;/para&gt;</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>When rendered, either on paper or in online form, this paragraph
        always appears without any of the content of the index terms:</para>

        <blockquote>
          <para>USB<!-- comment out <indexterm>
<primary>USB</primary><see>Universal Serial Bus</see>
</indexterm><indexterm>
<primary>Universal Serial Bus</primary></indexterm> --> and Firewire<!--<indexterm><primary>Firewire</primary></indexterm>-->
          are common interface technologies for external hard drives, although
          eSATA<!--<indexterm><primary>eSATA</primary><seealso>Serial ATA</seealso>
</indexterm>--> is also used.</para>
        </blockquote>

        <para>For most elements, the processing expectations of an
        <tag>indexterm</tag> are straightforward: the location of the
        term serves as an anchor for the cross-reference from the index. If
        the word “Firewire” appears on page 75 of the document, then page 75
        appears in the index entry for “Firewire”. In an online presentation,
        there’s an anchor for “Fireware” immediately after that word in the
        paragraph.</para>

        <para>Several aspects of index markup require special attention:
        whitespace around index terms, “See” and “See also” entries, index
        markup in repeating and floating elements, and multiple
        indexes.</para>

<refsection>
<title>Whitespace around index terms</title>

<para>Special care should be taken when entering <tag>indexterm</tag>s
into text, especially when one of the final output formats for your
document is paginated. Most processing systems are forgiving about the
amount of whitespace that you use. Outside of “line-specific”
environments such as <tag>literallayout</tag><phrase conformance="inschema"> and
<tag>programlisting</tag></phrase>, you can indent lines, insert tabs or spaces
at will, and otherwise rely on the processor to coalesce multiple
spaces into a single space.</para>

<para>However, when the processor is determining where a line or page
break will occur in a long block of text, it’s an almost universal
convention that such breaks occur where whitespace occurs in the
markup. Sometimes words have to be hyphenated, of course, but usually
it’s sufficient to break a line at a space and break a page between
lines.</para>

<para>This means that you want to <emphasis>avoid extraneous
spaces</emphasis> between index terms and the words with which they
are associated. Consider this example:</para>

          <programlisting>&lt;para&gt;…long, rambling paragraph about wood ducks
&lt;indexterm&gt;&lt;primary&gt;ducks&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;secondary&gt;wood&lt;/secondary&gt;
&lt;/indexterm&gt; and the habitat that they occupy, etc., etc., etc.
&lt;/para&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>At first glance this seems fine, but consider what happens if
          the processor needs to break this paragraph across two pages. There
          is a small, but nonzero, chance that the page break will occur at
          the space (introduced by the line break) following the word “ducks”.
          If this happens, the anchor associated with the entry “ducks, wood”
          will appear on the page <emphasis>following</emphasis> the relevant
          words. To avoid this situation, never insert whitespace between the
          term and the <tag>indexterm</tag>:</para>

          <programlisting>&lt;para&gt;…long, rambling paragraph about wood
ducks&lt;indexterm&gt;&lt;primary&gt;ducks&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;secondary&gt;wood&lt;/secondary&gt;
&lt;/indexterm&gt; and the habitat that they occupy, etc., etc., etc.
&lt;/para&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The whitespace <emphasis>after</emphasis> the
          <tag>indexterm</tag> is necessary, of course. Without it,
          when the <tag>indexterm</tag> is removed for presentation,
          the words “ducks” and “and” will appear to run together.</para>
        </refsection>

          <remark>[PROD: BEGIN replacement material from Norm (see RT #60317,
          Thu Feb 18 08:04:23 2010) —Tools]</remark>

          <para>Just as extraneous whitespace can lead to indexing errors,
          placing index terms between block elements may lead to indexing
          errors.</para>

          <para>If an index term occurs between two paragraphs, and a page
          break occurs between those two paragraphs, the processing system may
          associate the index entry with either page.</para>

          <para>This problem can be exacerbated by floating elements. Suppose
          an index term appears between two figures, both of which float to
          subsequent pages. There is no reliable way to predict what page the
          processing system will associate with that index term.</para>

          <para>If the index term in question marks the beginning or end of a
          range, the resulting range may contain too few, too many, or perhaps
          even only the wrong pages!</para>

          <para>As a general rule, it’s best to avoid placing index terms
          between block elements that may be broken across multiple
          pages.</para>
        </refsection>

        <refsection><info><title>Index terms in repeating and floating elements</title></info>
          

          <para>When an <tag>indexterm</tag> appears in an element
          whose content may be repeated in more than one place, the anchor is
          <emphasis>only</emphasis> associated with what would be considered
          the “primary” presentation (or presentations) of the element in the
          flow of the text. For example, in a traditional printed book, the
          <tag>title</tag> of a <tag>chapter</tag> might
          appear in the table of contents, in the running header, and in the
          body of the book on the first page of the chapter. If an
          <tag>indexterm</tag> is placed in the
          <tag>title</tag>, it serves as an anchor to
          <emphasis>only</emphasis> the first page of the chapter.</para>

          <para>If the processing expectations of an element are that it may
          be repeated several times and that each of these occurrences is
          equally “primary,”<footnote>
              <para>No elements in DocBook V5.0 have these semantics.</para>
            </footnote> then any <tag>indexterm</tag> occurring in
          that element should generate an anchor at each location where the
          content is <phrase role="keep-together">repeated</phrase>.</para>

          <para>If an <tag>indexterm</tag> appears in an element whose
          content may float, the anchor is to the location where the term
          occurs in the floated text. For example, if an
          <tag>indexterm</tag> occurs in a <tag>figure</tag>
          that floats to the top of some following page, the anchor is on the
          page where the figure actually occurs.</para>

          <remark>[PROD: END replacement material from Norm (see RT #60317,

        <refsection><info><title>“See” and “See also” entries</title></info>
          

          <para>The use of <tag>see</tag> and
          <tag>seealso</tag> elements in an
          <tag>indexterm</tag> also has special semantics.</para>

          <para>A <tag>see</tag> entry directs the reader to another
          location in the index. In <xref linkend="indexterm-example"/>, the
          entry for USB:</para>

          <programlisting>&lt;indexterm&gt;
&lt;primary&gt;USB&lt;/primary&gt;&lt;see&gt;Universal Serial Bus&lt;/see&gt;
&lt;/indexterm&gt;&lt;indexterm&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>directs the reader to the entry for Universal Serial Bus. The
          resulting index will look something like this:</para>

          <literallayout class="normal">…
Ubiquitous networking, 34, 44, 173-199
Universal Serial Bus, 50-55
Up time, 2, 5
USB, see Universal Serial Bus
Useless bits, 304, 411
…</literallayout>

          <para>There are no page numbers associated with a
          <tag>see</tag> entry. In most environments, if there is at
          least one <tag>see</tag> entry for a particular term, it is
          an error to have any other kind of entry for that term.</para>

          <para>A <tag>seealso</tag> entry, on the other hand, directs
          the reader to other, possibly related terms in the index. We expect
          the index for “eSATA” to look something like this:</para>

          <literallayout class="normal">…
Entering markup, 14, 18, 22-33
eSATA, 56, 58-61
  (see also Serial ATA)
evaluating expressions, 44
…</literallayout>

          <para>It’s entirely possible for a term to have several
          <tag>seealso</tag> entries.</para>
