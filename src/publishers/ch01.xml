  <title>Getting Started with <acronym>DocBook</acronym> Publishers</title>
</info>

<para>For more than a decade, DocBook has provided a structured markup
vocabulary for hardware and software documentation. DocBook is now
widely used in both commercial and Open Source environments. DocBook
has a very broad element set, and applies to much more than just
technical documentation. The DocBook TC is engaged in evolving the
suite of DocBook specifications. The community benefits from having a
standard, open, interchangeable vocabulary in which to write
structured content. DocBook has been, and will continue to be,
designed to satisfy this requirement.</para>

<para>The OASIS DocBook Schema for Publishers is an official variant
of DocBook v5.x, specifically designed to support the publishing
industry. Publications that the schema is designed to support includes
(but is not limited to): periodicals as regularly published technical
notes or journals, book publishing (such as business, legal, medical,
and other non-technical domains), educational textbooks and other
document types as appropriate for this industry.</para>

<para>Based on DocBook V5.0, the DocBook Publishers schema is
normatively available as a RELAX NG Schema (with some additional
Schematron assertions). Of the 361 total elements in the full DocBook
standard, the Publishers schema has been simplified to exclude 149
elements from full DocBook. Modifications have been made to 11
patterns from the DocBook schema. Additions to the schema include: the
Dublin Core metadata elements (54) and 6 new elements.</para>
