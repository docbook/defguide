</indexterm>One of the early factors that motivated the development of
DocBook was the desire for companies to interchange documents. In
particular, <acronym>UNIX</acronym> vendors wanted to be able to
interchange common <acronym>UNIX</acronym> documentation.</para>

<para>A great deal of effort went into making sure that DocBook could
handle most (probably all) of the documents that were likely to be
exchanged. This avoids the guaranteed problem of interchanging
documents created with extended schemas.</para>

<para>There are no unique interchange aspects to the Website customization.
