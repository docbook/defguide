<para><citetitle>DocBook Website: The Definitive Guide</citetitle> is
essentially a special edition of <citetitle>DocBook 5: The Definitive
Guide</citetitle>. It probably doesn't stand entirely on its own very
well. We assume, for example, that you're familiar with DocBook and
have read the introductory material from the original.</para>

<para>The element reference of this book describes the elements (and
content models) of the “website” schema, but the prose of those pages
is still largely the same as the prose from the original.
