<para><citetitle>DocBook Website: The Definitive Guide</citetitle> is essentially
a special edition of
<citetitle>DocBook 5: The Definitive Guide</citetitle>. It probably doesn't stand
entirely on its own very well. We assume, for example, that you're familiar with
DocBook and have read the introductory material from the original.</para>

<para>The element reference of this book describes the elements (and
content models) of the “website” schema, but the prose of those pages
is still largely the same as the prose from the original. Over time,
we expect that situation to change and improve.
</para>

<para>The only difference between the “website” schema and the “wesite-full”
schema is that the “website-full” schema allows all of the DocBook block
and inline elements.</para>
