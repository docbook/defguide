</info>

<para>The website customization comes in two flavors, “website” and
“website-full”. The only difference between these customizations is the
base version of DocBook. The “website” customization is a customization
of Simplified DocBook; “website-full” is a customization of full
DocBook.</para>

<para>This book documents the “website” customization.</para>

<para>The heart of this customization is a new root element
<tag>webpage</tag>. It corresponds, roughly, to a single HTML web page.
