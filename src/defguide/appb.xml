      </indexterm>The DocBook community has developed several variants that,
    while not part of the normative specification, have proven to be useful.
    These include:</para>

              <primary>Simplified DocBook</primary>
            </indexterm>Simplified DocBook is a proper subset of DocBook.
          Therefore, any valid instance will also be valid against the full
          DocBook schema. The objective is to provide a significantly smaller
          schema that is useful for articles and other small documents. As of
          the publication of this book, the latest version of Simplified
          DocBook was based on DocBook <acronym>V4.5</acronym>. Further
          information can be found at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.docbook.org/schemas/simplified">http://www.docbook.org/schemas/simplified</uri>.</para>

            </indexterm>The DocBook website schema is a customization of the
          schema designed for building websites. There is also support in the
          DocBook stylesheets for this schema. As of the publication of this
          book, there is a version of the schema based on DocBook
          <acronym>V5.0</acronym> under development. Information about the
          DocBook website and how to use it can be found in <citetitle>DocBook
          XSL: The Complete Guide</citetitle> <biblioref linkend="Stayton07"/> and at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/docbook/website/">http://www.dpawson.co.uk/docbook/website/</uri>. The latter
          has information about the DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> version of
          the schema.</para>

      </indexterm>With the introduction of DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>,
    there have been several new initiatives started to take advantage of the
    increased flexibility and customizability of the standard. Two of these
    initiatives have become subcommittees of the <acronym>OASIS</acronym>
    DocBook Technical Committee:</para>

          official variants of DocBook in support of the publishing industry.
          In May, 2009, this subcommittee released <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/docbook/specs/publishers-1.0-spec-cd-01.html">The

          <primary>topic-oriented writing</primary>
        </indexterm>In addition to these two subcommittees, there is a current
      effort to create markup for an <quote>assembly</quote> capability to
      better support development of documents using a modular approach.</para>

      <para>Most modular methodologies use a topic-oriented approach, where
      writers create independent units of information that are meant to stand
      alone. Topics are then collected into a library in much the same way
      that programmers create libraries of functions. Authors select the
      topics they need to assemble the documentation for a particular system
      from the library.</para>

      <para>In order to support modular methodologies, you need support for
      marking up individual topics, which DocBook does well. You also need
      support for some kind of <quote>map</quote> or <quote>assembly</quote>
      file that identifies which topics are required for a particular
      deliverable, and at least for print deliverables, what order they should
      be presented in.</para>

      <para>The proposed DocBook assembly would serve this purpose. While
      still under consideration as this book is being written, the general
      outline of an assembly is clear. It would identify a collection of
      resources (which could include topics and other modules), an ordering of
      those resources for a particular document, a set of relationships
      between resources, and the transformations that are to be applied to the
      collection.</para>

      <para>While DocBook already supports many aspects of topic-oriented
      writing, the assembly mechanism is being designed to provide a more
      capable and intuitive model for this type of methodology.</para>
