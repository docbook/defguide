<para>DocBook provides a system for writing structured documents using
<acronym>XML</acronym>. It is particularly well-suited to books and
papers about computer hardware and software, though it is by no means
limited to them. Because it is a large and robust format,
and because its main structures correspond to
the general notion of what constitutes a book, DocBook has been
adopted by a large and growing community of authors. DocBook is
supported <quote>out of the box</quote> by a wide range of tools, both open
source and commercial. In short, DocBook is an easy-to-understand and
widely used schema. Worldwide, hundreds (perhaps thousands) of organizations use
DocBook for millions of pages of documentation in a wide variety of print and
online formats.

  <title>Why Read This Book?</title>

  <para>This book is designed to be the clear, concise, normative reference to
  the DocBook schema. This book is the official documentation for DocBook.
  </para>

  <para>We hope to answer, definitively, all the questions you might
  have about all the elements and attributes in DocBook. In particular,
  we cover the following subjects:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry><term>Getting started with DocBook:</term>

    DocBook can be a bit overwhelming at first. We get you up to

    <varlistentry><term>Understanding the elements:</term>

    become the de facto standard way to process DocBook. This book
    contains a brief description about using the stylesheets, but for
    detailed information we recommend Bob Stayton's excellent book,

  <title>This Book's Audience</title>

  <para>We expect that most readers will have some familiarity with
  <acronym>XML</acronym>. Even if your experience goes no farther than
  writing a few <acronym>HTML</acronym> pages, you're probably in good
  shape. If you're not already familiar with <acronym>XML</acronym>,
  there are many popular books, including Erik Ray's <citetitle
  >Learning XML</citetitle><biblioref linkend="Ray03"/>. For a list
  of other resources, consult <xref linkend="app-resources"/>.
  </para>

  <note xml:id="sgml">
    <para>The previous edition of this book described some of the SGML-specific
    features available to users of the DocBook <acronym>DTD</acronym> versions 4.x
    and earlier. In this edition, we don't cover <acronym>SGML</acronym> at all. Starting with DocBook
    <acronym>V5.0</acronym>, DocBook is normatively an <acronym>XML</acronym> vocabulary.</para>

    <title>Using Code Examples</title>

    <para>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, you may
    use the code in this book in your programs and documentation. You do not
    need to contact us for permission unless youâ€™re reproducing a significant
    portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several
    chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or
    distributing a CD-ROM of examples from Oâ€™Reilly books does require
    permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example
    code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of
    example code from this book into your productâ€™s documentation does require
    permission.</para>

    <para>We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution
    usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example:
    <quote><citetitle>DocBook: The Definitive Guide, Second Edition</citetitle> by Norman Walsh. Copyright 2010 Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., ISBN: 978-0-596-8050-2-9.</quote></para>

    <title>Acknowledgments</title>

<para>This book wouldn't exist, there wouldn't have been any point in
writing it, were it not for DocBook's enthusiastic support from an
entire community of writers, engineers, managers, and other users. My
thanks to you all.</para>

<para>It also wouldn't exist if my wife was not so understanding and
supportive. Writing a book invariable takes more time and effort than
one imagines, time first borrowed from, then begged, and eventually
stolen from other activities. Thank you, Deb!</para>

<para>And, to conclude a series, it also wouldn't exist were it not
for Dick Hamilton's encouragement and hard work. Dick first persuaded me
to complete a second edition in print, then offered to publish it. He
negotiated with O'Reilly, agreed to edit it, and wrote more of it than
he could be persuaded to take credit for. Thank you, Dick.</para>

<para>Several sections in this book use material from <link
xlink:href="http://docbook.org/docs/howto/"><quote>DocBook V5.0: The
Transition Guide,</quote></link> also known as the <quote>DocBook
How-to.</quote> Thanks to Jirka Kosek and Michael
Smith for their work on the How-to.
</para>

<para>Thanks to Nancy Harrison, Scott Hudson, Mauritz Jeanson, Jirka
Kosek, and Larry Rowland for their technical review of the book.
</para>

<para>Thanks to Bob Stayton for being Secretary to the Technical
Committee and to Scott Hudson for chairing the eLearning and Publisher's
Subcommittees and for being the driving force behind those two initiatives.
Thanks also to the entire DocBook Technical Committee for
contributing time every month to the continued maintenance of DocBook.
