<para>The slides customization comes in two flavors, “slides” and
“slides-full”. The only difference between these customizations is the
base version of DocBook. The “slides” customization is a customization
of Simplified DocBook; “slides-full” is a customization of full
DocBook.</para>

<para>This book documents the “slides” customization.</para>

<para>The heart of this customization is a new root element
<tag>slides</tag> and its children: <tag>foil</tag> and
<tag>foilgroup</tag>.</para>
