<glossterm>CDATA section</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>A CDATA section is a region of text in an XML document delimited by
<code>&lt;![[</code> at the beginning and <code>]]&gt;</code> at the end.
All of the characters in a CDATA section are taken literally as part of the document.
In other words, literal “&lt;” characters, “&amp;” characters, and other markup
characters are not interpreted as markup. The delimiters are not rendered.
</para>
<para>CDATA sections are a convenience for authoring, they are not part of the
XML data model. After the document has been parsed, it is not possible to determine
where CDATA sections where used (as opposed to other forms of escaping, such
as character entities).
