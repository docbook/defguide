      </indexterm>DocBook is more than 15 years old. It began in 1991 as a
    joint project of HaL Computer Systems and O’Reilly &amp; Associates (as
    O’Reilly Media, Inc. was then called). Its popularity grew, and eventually
    it spawned its own maintenance organization, the Davenport
    Group.<indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="idx.davenport">
        <primary>Davenport Group</primary>
      </indexterm> In mid-1998, maintenance moved to a Technical Committee of

    of Structured Information Standards (<acronym>OASIS</acronym>).<indexterm>

    <para>DocBook’s roots are in <firstterm linkend="gloss-sgml">SGML</firstterm>, where it was defined with a
    Document Type Definition, or <acronym>DTD</acronym>. DocBook was released
    as both an <acronym>SGML</acronym> and an <firstterm linkend="gloss-xml"><acronym>XML</acronym></firstterm> vocabulary starting
    with <acronym>V4.1</acronym>. The <acronym>V4.x</acronym> versions of
    DocBook, like the versions that came before them, were also defined with a
    <acronym>DTD</acronym>. Starting with DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>,
    DocBook is exclusively an <acronym>XML</acronym> vocabulary defined with
    RELAX NG and Schematron.</para>

        </indexterm>The DocBook <acronym>DTD</acronym> was originally designed
      and implemented by HaL Computer Systems and O’Reilly &amp; Associates
      around 1991. It was developed primarily to facilitate the exchange of
      <acronym>UNIX</acronym> documentation originally marked up in
      <command>troff</command>. Its design appears to have been based partly
      on input from <acronym>SGML</acronym> interchange projects conducted by

      discussion about its revision and maintenance began in earnest in the

      Novell and <phrase role="keep-together">Digital</phrase>.</para>

      <para>In 1994, the Davenport Group became an officially chartered entity

      simultaneously. The <phrase role="keep-together">founding</phrase>

      <para>Under the auspices of the Davenport Group, the DocBook
      <acronym>DTD</acronym> began to widen its scope. It was now being used
      by a much wider audience and for new purposes such as direct authoring
      with <acronym>SGML</acronym>-aware tools and publishing directly to
      paper. As the largest users of DocBook, Novell and Sun had a heavy
      influence on its design.</para>

          <secondary>rules for new releases</secondary>
        </indexterm>In order to help users manage change, the new Davenport
      charter established the following rules for DocBook releases:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Minor versions (<quote>point releases</quote> such as
          <acronym>V2.2</acronym>) could add to the markup model, but could
          not change it in a backward-incompatible way. For example, a new
          kind of list element could be added, but it would not be acceptable
          for the existing itemized list model to start requiring two list
          items inside it instead of only one. Thus, any document conforming
          to version <replaceable>n</replaceable>.0 would also conform to
          <replaceable>n</replaceable>.<replaceable>m</replaceable>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Major versions (such as <acronym>V3.0</acronym>) could both
          add to the markup model and make backward-incompatible changes.
          However, the changes would have to be <phrase role="keep-together">announced</phrase> in the last major
          release.</para>

          <para>In 2009, the Technical Committee updated this policy to allow
          <phrase role="keep-together">backward-</phrase><phrase role="keep-together">incompatible</phrase> changes in a major
          version, provided the change is announced in a major or minor
          release at least six months in advance.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Major version introductions must be separated by at least a
          year.</para>

      DocBook’s audience continued to grow, but many of the Davenport Group
      stalwarts became involved in the <acronym>XML</acronym> effort, and
      development slowed dramatically. The idea of creating an official
      <acronym>XML</acronym>-compliant version of DocBook was discussed, but
      not implemented at that time.</para>

        </indexterm>In July 1998, the sponsors moved the standards activities

      The transition from Davenport to <acronym>OASIS</acronym> was very
      smooth, in part because the core team remained essentially the
      same.</para>

      <para>DocBook <acronym>V3.1</acronym>, published in February 1999, was
      the first <acronym>OASIS</acronym> release. It integrated a number of
      changes that had been <quote>in the wings</quote> for some time. In
      March 2000, Norm Walsh became chair of the Technical Committee.
      <remark>Norm: is this date correct?</remark></para>

      <para>In February 2001, <acronym>OASIS</acronym> made DocBook
      <acronym>SGML</acronym> <acronym>V4.1</acronym> and DocBook

      <para>In October 2005, the DocBook Technical Committee released the
      first beta test version of DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>. Development
      of the DocBook <acronym>4.x</acronym> series continued in parallel with
      the development of <acronym>V5.0</acronym>. In October 2006, the DocBook
      Technical Committee released DocBook <acronym>V4.5</acronym>, the last
      release planned in the <acronym>4.x</acronym> series.</para>

      <para>In 2008, the Publisher’s Subcommittee was chartered to develop and
      maintain official variants of DocBook in support of the publishing
      industry. The subcommittee focuses on schema customizations to support:
      periodicals as regularly published technical notes or journals, book
      publishing (such as business, legal, medical, and other nontechnical
      domains), educational textbooks, and other document types as appropriate
      for this industry.</para>

      <para>DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> became an official Committee
      Specification in June 2009 and became an official
      <acronym>OASIS</acronym> Standard in October 2009. <remark>Date may need
      to change if voting is delayed</remark> The Technical Committee
      continues DocBook development to ensure that the schema will continue to
      meet the needs of its users.<indexterm class="endofrange" startref="idx.dbhistory-1"/><indexterm class="endofrange" startref="idx.dbhistory-2"/></para>

    <para>DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> represents a major step forward for
    DocBook. The differences between DocBook <acronym>4.x</acronym> and
    <acronym>V5.0</acronym> are quite radical in some aspects, but the basic
    idea behind DocBook is still the same, and almost all element names are
    unchanged. Because of this it is very easy to become familiar with DocBook
    <acronym>V5.0</acronym> if you know any previous version of
    DocBook.</para>

          </indexterm>DocBook versions earlier than DocBook
        <acronym>V5.0</acronym> use unique elements for block information. For
        example, a <tag>book</tag> element would contain a
        <tag role="nonexistant">bookinfo</tag> element. This was done to support
        different content models for different block elements. DTDs only allow
        one content model for each element, so a different element name was
        required for each block’s information element.</para>

        <para>RELAX NG does not have this limitation. An element can have a
        different content model in different contexts. Therefore, the array of
        info elements (<tag role="nonexistant">articleinfo</tag>, <tag role="nonexistant">bookinfo</tag>, etc.) has been replaced with
        a single <tag>info</tag> element.</para>

        this constraint. With RELAX NG, this constraint can now be enforced in
        the schema.</para>

        <para>DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> no longer requires a Document

        appear on the root element of a DocBook document. The <tag class="attribute">version</tag> attribute may also appear on other
        elements, and mixing of versions is allowed.</para>

    <para>The only change is the addition of a default namespace declaration

<title>Namespace Usage Policy</title>
</info>

<para>DocBook is used throughout the world. As one would expect in such a
broad context, DocBook is often customized to satisfy the requirements
of specific organizations or projects. The DocBook Technical Committee encourages such
customization and works hard to make sure that the schemas are as
amenable to customization as possible.</para>

<para>When customizers add new elements to DocBook, they often place those
elements in the DocBook namespace.
There is historical precedent for this approach as DocBook's history
pre-dates namespaces and even XML. Even without precedent, users would
almost certainly encourage customizers to use the same namespace. In
many cases it simplifies authoring and almost always simplifies the
training of new authors.</para>

<para>However, a new element introduced into the DocBook namespace by a
local customization is not officially part of DocBook. Only the
DocBook Technical Committee can introduce new elements into DocBook officially by
publishing a new version of the standard with those elements.</para>

<para>This means that the practice of adding new, local elements into the DocBook
namespace comes with a cost:
the potential for confusion among authors familiar with different
customizations and the costs associated with resolving any conflicts
between interchange partners.
</para>

<para>The DocBook Technical Committee encourages customizers to think carefully about these
costs and weight the potential tradoffs between unofficially adding
elements to DocBook and using elements in their own namespace with
care.</para>

    <para><indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="idx.introduction-rng">
        <primary>RELAX NG</primary>
      </indexterm>For more than a decade, the DocBook schema was defined using
    a <acronym>DTD</acronym>. However, <acronym>DTD</acronym>s have serious
    limitations, and DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> is thus defined using a
    powerful schema language called RELAX NG. Thanks to RELAX NG, it is now
    much easier to create customized versions of DocBook, and the content
    models are now cleaner and more precise.</para>

    <para>Using RELAX NG has an impact on the document prolog. <xref linkend="ex.docbook45"/> shows the typical prolog of a DocBook
    <acronym>4.x</acronym> document. The version of the DocBook
    <acronym>DTD</acronym> (in this case <acronym>V4.5</acronym>) is indicated
    in the Document Type Declaration (&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;) that points to a
    particular version of the <acronym>DTD</acronym>.</para>

    <example xml:id="ex.docbook45"><info><title>DocBook <acronym>V4.5</acronym> document</title></info>
      

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC '-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN'

&lt;article lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample article&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;para&gt;This is a very short article.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>In contrast, DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> does not depend on
    <acronym>DTD</acronym>s anymore. Instead of the Document Type Declaration,
    the <tag class="attribute">version</tag> attribute identifies the
    DocBook version, as shown in <xref linkend="ex.docbook5"/>.</para>

    <example xml:id="ex.docbook5"><info><title>DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> document</title></info>
      

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;article xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0" xml:lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample article&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;para&gt;This is a very short article.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> is built on top of existing
    <acronym>XML</acronym> standards as much as possible. For example, the
    <tag class="attribute">lang</tag> attribute is superseded by the
    standard <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-lang-tag"><tag class="attribute">xml:lang</tag></link> attribute.<indexterm>
        <primary>xml:lang attribute</primary>
      </indexterm></para>

    is the future.</quote> Apart from this marketing blurb, there are also

          <para>DocBook <acronym>V4.5</acronym> is the last version of DocBook
          in the <acronym>4.x</acronym> series. Any new DocBook development,
          like the addition of new elements, will be done in DocBook
          <acronym>V5.0</acronym>. It is only a matter of time before new
          elements are added into DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>, but they
          are not likely to be back-ported into DocBook
          <acronym>4.x</acronym>. DocBook <acronym>4.x</acronym> will be in

    <para>Schemas for DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> are available in several
    formats at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/</uri> (or the mirror
    at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://docbook.org/xml/5.0/">http://docbook.org/xml/5.0/</uri>). Only the RELAX NG
    schema is normative, and it is preferred over the other schema languages.
    For your convenience there are also <acronym>DTD</acronym> and W3C
    <acronym>XML</acronym> Schema versions provided for DocBook
    <acronym>V5.0</acronym>. However, neither the <acronym>DTD</acronym> nor
    the W3C <acronym>XML</acronym> schema can capture all the constraints of
    DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym>. This means that a document that validates
    against the <acronym>DTD</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> schema is not
    necessarily valid against the RELAX NG schema, and thus may not be a valid
    DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> document.</para>

    <para><acronym>DTD</acronym> and W3C <acronym>XML</acronym> Schema
    versions of the DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> grammar are provided as a
    convenience for users who want to use DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> with
    legacy tools that don’t support RELAX NG. Authors are encouraged to switch
    to RELAX NG-based tools as soon as possible, or at least to validate
    documents against the RELAX NG schema before further processing.</para>

    <para>Some document constraints can’t be expressed in grammar-based schema
    languages like RELAX NG or W3C <acronym>XML</acronym> Schema. To define
    these additional constraints DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> uses
    Schematron. We recommend that you validate your document against both the
    RELAX NG and Schematron schemas.</para>

    <para>Whether you’re just getting started with DocBook, or curating a
    collection of tens of thousands of DocBook documents, one question that
    you have to consider is <quote>how stable is DocBook?</quote> Will the
    documents that you write today still be useful tomorrow, or next year, or
    in the next century?</para>

    <para>This question may seem particularly pertinent if you’re in the
    process of converting a collection of DocBook <acronym>4.x</acronym>
    documents to DocBook <acronym>V5.0</acronym> because we introduced a
    number of backward-incompatible changes in <acronym>V5.0</acronym>.</para>

    <para>The DocBook Technical Committee understands that the community
    benefits from the long-term stability of the DocBook family of schemas. We
    also understand that DocBook must continue to adapt and change in order to
    remain relevant in a changing world.</para>

    <para>All changes, and especially changes that are backward incompatible
    (changes that make a currently valid document no longer valid under a new
    version of the schema), have a cost associated with them. The technical
    committee must balance those costs against the need to remain responsive
    to the community’s desire to see DocBook grow to cover the new use cases
    that inevitably arise in documentation.</para>

    <para>With that in mind, the DocBook Technical Committee has adopted the
    following policy on backward-incompatible changes. This policy spells out
    when <phrase role="keep-together">backward-</phrase><phrase role="keep-together">incompatible</phrase> changes can occur and how much
    notice the technical committee must provide before adopting a schema that
    is backward incompatible with the current <phrase role="keep-together">release</phrase>.</para>

    <para>This policy allows DocBook to continue to change and adapt while
    simultaneously guaranteeing that existing users will have sufficient
    advance notice to develop reasonable migration plans.</para>

    <para>With respect to schema changes, the technical committee asserts that
    the following points will always apply:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A point release (X.1 to X.2, X.2 to X.3, X.1 to X.1.2, etc.)
        <emphasis>will not</emphasis> contain any backward-incompatible
        changes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A major release (X.1 to Y.0, X.2 to Y.0, X.1.2 to Y.0, etc.)
        <glossterm>may</glossterm> contain backward-incompatible changes
        if:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the change was announced in the release notes for the
            previous version (major or minor) and</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>the change was announced in a release that occurred at least
            six months <phrase role="keep-together">previously</phrase>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>By these rules, the technical committee can announce, in
    <acronym>V5.1</acronym>, for example, its plans to make a
    backward-incompatible change in V6.0. Then, in V6.0, if it’s been at least
    six months since <acronym>V5.1</acronym> was released, it can make that
    change.</para>

    <para>As a general rule, the technical committee tries to avoid
    backward-incompatible changes.</para>
