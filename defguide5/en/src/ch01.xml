DocBook is a very popular set of tags for describing books, articles,
and other prose documents, particularly technical
documentation. DocBook is defined using the native <acronym>DTD</acronym> syntax of
<acronym>SGML</acronym> and <acronym>XML</acronym>. Like <acronym>HTML</acronym>, DocBook is an example of a markup
language defined in <acronym>SGML</acronym>/<acronym>XML</acronym>.

<para>
DocBook is almost 10 years old. It began in 1991 as a joint project of
HaL Computer Systems and O'Reilly. Its popularity grew, and eventually
it spawned its own maintenance organization, the Davenport Group. In
mid-1998, it became a Technical Committee (<acronym>TC</acronym>) of
the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
Standards (<acronym>OASIS</acronym>).

The DocBook <acronym>DTD</acronym> was originally designed and implemented by HaL
Computer Systems and O'Reilly &amp; Associates around 1991. It was
developed primarily to facilitate the exchange of <acronym>UNIX</acronym> documentation
originally marked up in <command>troff</command>. Its design appears
to have been based partly on input from <acronym>SGML</acronym> interchange projects
conducted by the Unix International and Open Software Foundation
consortia.

When DocBook <acronym>V1.1</acronym> was published, discussion about
its revision and maintenance began in earnest in the Davenport Group,
a forum created by O'Reilly for computer documentation
producers. Version 1.2 was influenced strongly by
Novell and Digital.
</para>
<para>
In 1994, the Davenport Group became an officially chartered entity
responsible for DocBook's maintenance. DocBook
<acronym>V1.2.2</acronym> was published simultaneously. The founding
sponsors of this incarnation of Davenport include the following

<para>
Under the auspices of the Davenport Group, the DocBook <acronym>DTD</acronym> began to
widen its scope. It was now being used by a much wider audience, and
for new purposes, such as direct authoring with <acronym>SGML</acronym>-aware tools,
and publishing directly to paper. As the largest users of DocBook,
Novell and Sun had a heavy influence on its design.

  <secondary>releases, rules for new versions</secondary></indexterm>

In order to help users manage change, the new Davenport charter established
the following rules for DocBook releases:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Minor versions (<quote>point releases</quote> such as
<acronym>V2.2</acronym>) could add to the markup model, but could not
change it in a backward-incompatible way. For example, a new kind of
list element could be added, but it would not be acceptable for the
existing itemized-list model to start requiring two list items inside
it instead of only one. Thus, any document conforming to version
<replaceable>n</replaceable>.0 would also conform to
<replaceable>n</replaceable>.<replaceable>m</replaceable>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Major versions (such as <acronym>V3.0</acronym>) could
both add to the markup model and make backward-incompatible
changes. However, the changes would have to be announced in the last
major release.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Major-version introductions must be separated by at
least a year.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

  <secondary>XML</secondary>
    <tertiary>XML-compliant version</tertiary></indexterm>
<indexterm significance="normal"><primary>XML</primary>
  <secondary>DocBook version compliant with</secondary></indexterm>

<acronym>V3.0</acronym> was released in January 1997. After that time,
although DocBook's audience continued to grow, many of the Davenport
Group stalwarts became involved in the <acronym>XML</acronym> effort, and development
slowed dramatically. The idea of creating an official <acronym>XML</acronym>-compliant
version of DocBook was discussed, but not implemented. (For more
detailed information about DocBook <acronym>V3.0</acronym> and plans
for subsequent versions, see <xref linkend="app-versions"/>.)

The sponsors wanted to close out Davenport in an orderly way to ensure
that DocBook users would be supported. It was suggested that
<acronym>OASIS</acronym> become DocBook's new home. An
<acronym>OASIS</acronym> DocBook Technical Committee was formed in
July, 1998, with Eduardo Gutentag of Sun Microsystems as chair.

The <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">DocBook Technical
Commitee</link> is continuing the work started by the
Davenport Group. The transition from Davenport to
<acronym>OASIS</acronym> has been very smooth, in part because the
core design team consists of essentially the same individuals (we all
just changed hats).

<para>
DocBook <acronym>V3.1</acronym>, published in February 1999, was the
first <acronym>OASIS</acronym> release.  It integrated a number of
changes that had been <quote>in the wings</quote> for some time.
