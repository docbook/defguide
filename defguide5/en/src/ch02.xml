</indexterm>This chapter explains in concrete, practical terms how to
make DocBook documents. It's an overview of all the kinds of markup
that are possible in DocBook documents. It explains how to create
several kinds of DocBook documents: books, sets of books, chapters,
articles, and reference manual entries. The idea is to give you enough
basic information to actually start writing. The information here is
intentionally skeletal; you can find the details in the
reference section of this book.

</indexterm>An <acronym>XML</acronym> consists of an optional
XML Declaration, an optional Document Type Declaration, which includes
an optional Internal Subset, and a Document (or Root) Element.
If you're used to using a DTD, many of these will be familiar to you.
If you're using the RELAX NG version of DocBook, many of your documents
will omit the Document Type Declaration.</para>

<acronym>XML</acronym> declaration that identifies a few simple aspects of
the document, for example:</para>
<screen>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</screen>

<para>Identifying the version of <acronym>XML</acronym> ensures that
future changes to the <acronym>XML</acronym> specification will not
alter the semantics of this document. The encoding declaration
tells the processor what character encoding this document uses.
It must match the actual encoding that you use. The
complete details of the <acronym>XML</acronym> declaration are
described in the <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml"><acronym>XML</acronym>

</para>

<para>If your document uses XML 1.0 and an encoding of either
<literal role="encoding">utf-8</literal> or
<literal role="encoding">utf-16</literal>,
the XML Declaration is not required. But it is never wrong to include
it. If you do not include an XML declaration, your document must conform
to XML 1.0. If you want to use XML 1.1, you must include an XML Declaration
and specify <code>version="1.1"</code> in it.</para>

</indexterm>The document type declaration identifies what the root
element of the document will be and may specify the DTD that should be
used when parsing the document. A typical doctype declaration
for a DocBook V4.4 document looks like this:
</para>

<screen>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.4//EN"
               "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.4/docbookx.dtd"&gt;</screen>

  <secondary>XML</secondary>
</indexterm>This declaration indicates that the root element will be
<tag>book</tag> and that the <acronym>DTD</acronym>
used will be DocBook V4.4. In this example, the
<acronym>DTD</acronym> is stored on a web server.
<indexterm>
  <primary>URI</primary>
  <secondary>XML system identifiers</secondary>
</indexterm>System identifiers in <acronym>XML</acronym> must be
<acronym>URI</acronym>s. Almost all systems accept filenames and
interpret them locally as <literal>file:</literal>
<acronym>URL</acronym>s, but it's always correct to fully qualify
them.
</para>

<para>You can specify a DTD for DocBook V5.0 documents:</para>

<screen>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V5.0//EN"
               "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/docbook.dtd"&gt;</screen>

<para>But the limited constraints that can be expressed in DTDs mean
that the resulting document may or may not <emphasis>really</emphasis>
be valid DocBook V5.0. The normative schema for DocBook V5.0 is
the RELAX NG Grammar with its Schematron annotations.</para>

<para>The only reason to use a DTD with DocBook V5.0 is if your
editing environment (or other tool) requires one, for example, for
syntax directed editing.</para>

</indexterm>One reason to use a Document Type Declaration with DocBook
V5.0 is to provide local declarations such as entities:</para>

<screen>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book [
&lt;!ENTITY nwalsh "Norman Walsh"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM "chap2.xml"&gt;
]&gt;</screen>

<para>These declarations form what is known as the internal subset. In
this example, the DTD has been omitted, but the two are not mutually
exclusive. If you are using a DTD (which is technically known as the
“<firstterm>external subset</firstterm>”), you can include the
internal subset immediately after the DTD:</para>

<screen>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V5.0/EN"
               "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0/docbook.dtd" [

]&gt;</screen>


<para><indexterm>
  <primary>parsing</primary>
  <secondary>order</secondary>
  <tertiary>XML document declarations</tertiary>
</indexterm>When both are specified, the internal subset is parsed
<emphasis>first</emphasis>. If multiple declarations for an entity
occur, the first declaration is used. This means that declarations in
the internal subset override declarations in the external
subset.</para>

  <secondary>root element</secondary>
</indexterm>All <acronym>XML</acronym> documents must have exactly one
root element, although it may have sibling comments and processing
instructions. If the document has a document type declaration, the
root element usually immediately follows it:</para>

<screen>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book [
&lt;!ENTITY nwalsh "Norman Walsh"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.xml"&gt;

&lt;book xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"&gt;…&lt;/book&gt;</screen>

<para>The important point is that the root element must be physically
present immediately after the document type declaration. You cannot
place the root element of the document in an external entity.</para>

public identifier is optional.

</indexterm>In <acronym>XML</acronym> the system identifier
must be a Uniform Resource Identifier (<acronym>URI</acronym>).
The most common <acronym>URI</acronym> today is the Uniform Resource
Locator (<acronym>URL</acronym>), which is familiar to anyone who
browses the Web.
</para>

<para>The historical advantage of using a public identifier is that it
made your documents more portable. For any system on which DocBook is
installed, the public identifier will resolve to the appropriate local
version of the <acronym>DTD</acronym> (if public identifiers can be
resolved at all). Today most systems can resolve system identifiers in
a similar way.
</para>

<para>Public identifiers have two disadvantages:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Because <acronym>XML</acronym> does not require them, and because system
identifiers are required, <acronym>XML</acronym> tools may not provide
adequate support for public identifiers. To work with these systems
you must use system identifiers.</para>

</indexterm>Public identifiers aren't magic. They're simply a method
of indirection. For them to work, there must be a resolution mechanism
for public identifiers. Luckily, there are standards that define
mechanisms for mapping public identifiers to
system identifers using catalog files.</para>

  <primary>uniqueness</primary>

</indexterm>An important characteristic of public identifiers is that
they are intended to be <emphasis>globally unique</emphasis>.
Referring to a document with a public identifier should mean that the
identifier will resolve to the same actual document on any system, even
though the location of that document on each system may vary. As a
rule, you should never reuse public identifiers, and a published
revision should have a new public identifier. Not following these
rules defeats one purpose of the public identifier.

  <secondary>documents (DocBook)</secondary>
</indexterm>The rest of this chapter describes how you can break
documents into logical chunks, such as books, chapters, sections, and
so on. Before we begin, and while the subject of the internal subset
is fresh in your mind, let's take a quick look at how to break
documents into separate files.
</para>

<para>Actually, we've already told you how to do it. If you recall, in
the preceding sections we had declarations of the form:</para>

<screen>&lt;!ENTITY <replaceable>name</replaceable> SYSTEM "<replaceable>filename</replaceable>"&gt;</screen>

<para><indexterm>
  <primary>entities</primary>
  <secondary>inserting files</secondary>
</indexterm>If you refer to the entity <replaceable>name</replaceable>
in your document after this declaration, the system will insert the
contents of the file <replaceable>filename</replaceable> into your
document at that point. So, if you've got a book that consists of
three chapters and two appendixes, you might create a file called
<filename>book.xml</filename>, which looks like this:
</para>

<screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE book [
&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM "chap2.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY chap3 SYSTEM "chap3.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY appa SYSTEM "appa.xml"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY appb SYSTEM "appb.xml"&gt;
]&gt;
&lt;book xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My First Book&lt;/title&gt;
&amp;chap1;
&amp;chap2;
&amp;chap3;
&amp;appa;
&amp;appb;
&lt;/book&gt;</screen>

<para><indexterm>
  <primary>declarations</primary>
  <secondary>document type declaration</secondary>
</indexterm><indexterm>
  <primary>document type declaration</primary>
  <secondary>divisions of documents</secondary>
</indexterm>You can then write the chapters and appendixes
conveniently in separate files. Documents that you reference with
external parsed entities are forbidden from having a Document Type
Declaration.
</para>

<para>For example, Chapter 1 might begin like this:
</para>

<screen>&lt;chapter id="ch1"&gt;&lt;title&gt;My First Chapter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;para&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/para&gt;
…</screen>

<para>But it must not begin with its own document type declaration:
</para>

<screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE chapter&gt;
&lt;chapter xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
         id="ch1"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My First Chapter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;para&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/para&gt;
…</screen>

<para>It is also possible to construct documents from different files
using XInclude. Recasting the previous example using XInclude,
yields:</para>

<screen>&lt;book xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My First Book&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="chap1.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="chap2.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="chap3.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="appa.xml"/&gt;
&lt;xi:include href="appb.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;</screen>

<para>Notice that we can completely omit the Document Type Declaration
in this case, but we must declare the XInclude namespace.</para>

<para>The essential tradeoffs between external parsed entities and XInclude
are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>XInclude can be used in a document that does not have a Document Type
Declaration. Many web services applications (ones that rely on SOAP, anyway)
forbid a Document Type Declaration and therefore cannot use entities of
any sort.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The documents <emphasis>referenced by</emphasis> XInclude are complete,
free-standing XML documents. They can declare their own local entities using
a Document Type Declaration.
Documents referenced by external parsed entities cannot
have a Document Type Declaration. If they use entities, those entities must
be declared in the document that does the including.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>External parsed entities can have multiple top-level elements. They
are not required to be “single rooted”. XIncluded documents must be wholly
well-formed XML.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>All XML parsers support external parsed entities. (Parsers which do
not <emphasis>are not</emphasis> conformant XML processors.) XInclude is
a separate specification and may or may not be supported by tools.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The XML parser expands entities and therefore “sees” the entire
document. This means that ID/IDREF links can freely cross entity boundaries.
Because XIncluded documents are free-standing, a document containing an
IDREF that crosses a document boundary cannot be valid. It can be well-formed,
and processors can do the right thing, but the parser cannot determine that
the document is valid. What's more, the same ID value can occur in several
XIncluded documents without causing a validity error. This may have a
consequence on the resulting processing.
</para>

</indexterm>A <tag>book</tag> is probably the most common top-level

gives you free reign. It's very reasonable to use a local <xref linkend="app-customizing"/> to impose a more strict ordering for your

  <secondary>sections</secondary>
</indexterm>There are several flavors of sectioning elements in
DocBook:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
  <term><tag>sect1</tag></term>
  <term><tag>sect2</tag></term>
  <term><tag>sect3</tag></term>
  <term><tag>sect4</tag></term>
  <term><tag>sect5</tag></term>
<listitem>
<para>The <tag>sect1</tag>…<tag>sect5</tag>
elements are the most common sectioning elements. They can occur in
most component-level elements. These numbered section elements must be
properly nested (<tag>sect2</tag>s can only occur inside
<tag>sect1</tag>s, <tag>sect3</tag>s can only occur inside
<tag>sect2</tag>s, and so on).  There are five levels of numbered
sections.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><tag>section</tag> element</term>
<listitem>
<para><indexterm>
  <primary>Section element</primary>
</indexterm>The <tag>section</tag> element is an alternative to
numbered sections. The <tag>section</tag> elements are recursive,
meaning that you can nest them to any depth desired.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><tag>simplesect</tag> element</term>
<listitem>
<para><indexterm>
  <primary>SimpleSect element</primary>
</indexterm>In addition to numbered sections, there's the
<tag>simplesect</tag> element. It is a terminal section that can occur
at any level, but it cannot have any other sectioning element nested
within it.</para>
<para>The distinguishing feature of <tag>simplesect</tag> is that it
does not occur in the Table of Contents.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><tag>bridgehead</tag></term>
<listitem>
<para><indexterm>
  <primary>BridgeHead element</primary>
</indexterm>A <tag>bridgehead</tag> provides a section title without
any containing section.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><tag>refsect1</tag>…<tag>refsect3</tag> elements</term>
<listitem>
<para><indexterm>
  <primary>RefEntry element</primary>

</indexterm>These elements, which occur only in <tag>refentry</tag>s,
are analogous to the numbered section elements in components. There
are only three levels of numbered section elements in a
<tag>refentry</tag>.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><tag>glossdiv</tag>, <tag>bibliodiv</tag>, and

  <primary>bibliography element</primary>
</indexterm><indexterm>
  <primary>index element</primary>
</indexterm>The <tag>glossary</tag>, <tag>bibliography</tag>,
and <tag>index</tag> elements can be broken into top-level
divisions, but not sections.  Unlike sections, these elements do not
nest.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</section>

<section xml:id="s.meta"><info><title>Meta-Information</title></info>
<para><indexterm>
  <primary>meta-information</primary>
  <secondary>elements</secondary>
</indexterm><indexterm>
  <primary>wrappers</primary>
  <secondary>meta-information</secondary>
</indexterm>All of the elements at the section level and above, and
many other elements, include a wrapper for meta-information about the
content. That element is named <tag>info</tag>. In earlier versions of
DocBook, there were many similarly named elements for this purpose,
<literal>bookinfo</literal>, <literal>chapterinfo</literal>, etc. In
DocBook V5.0, there is only one.

  <secondary>keyword sets (meta-information)</secondary>
</indexterm><indexterm>

  <secondary>metainformation</secondary>
</indexterm>The meta-information wrapper is designed to contain
bibliographic information about the content (<tag>author</tag>,
<tag>title</tag>, <tag>publisher</tag>, and so on) as well as other
meta-information such as revision histories, keyword sets, and index
terms.

<para>The <tag>title</tag>, <tag>titleabbrev</tag>, and
<tag>subtitle</tag> elements can usually appear either immediately before
or inside the <tag>info</tag> wrapper (but not both). This means you don't
need the extra wrapper in the common case where all you want to specify is
a title.</para>

</indexterm>The block elements occur immediately below the component
and sectioning elements. These are the (roughly) paragraph-level
elements in DocBook. They can be divided into a number of categories:
lists, admonitions, line-specific environments, synopses of several
sorts, tables, figures, examples, and a dozen or more miscellaneous
elements.

  <primary>inline elements</primary>
  <secondary>block elements vs.</secondary>
</indexterm>At the paragraph-level, it's convenient to divide elements
into two classes, <firstterm>block</firstterm> and
<firstterm>inline</firstterm>. From a structural point of view, this
distinction is based loosely on their relative size, but it's easiest
to describe the difference in terms of their presentation.

  <primary>quotations (block)</primary>
</indexterm>Block elements are usually presented with a paragraph (or
larger) break before and after them. Most can contain other block
elements, and many can contain character data and inline elements.
Paragraphs, lists, sidebars, tables, and block quotations are all
common examples of block elements.

</indexterm>Inline elements are generally represented without any
obvious breaks. The most common distinguishing mark of inline elements
is a font change, but inline elements may present no visual
distinction at all. Inline elements contain character data and
possibly other inline elements, but they never contain block elements.
Inline elements are used to mark up data such as cross references,
filenames, commands, options, subscripts and superscripts, and
glossary terms.

<para>All of the admonitions have the same structure: an optional

  <primary>Para element</primary>

<tag>inlineequation</tag>).
</para>
<para>
Informal equations don't have titles. For reasons of
backward-compatibility, <tag>equation</tag>s are not required
to have titles. However, it may be more difficult for some stylesheet
languages to properly enumerate <tag>equation</tag>s if they
lack titles.

Users of DocBook are provided with a surfeit of inline elements.
Inline elements are used to mark up running text.  In published
documents, inline elements often cause a font change or other small
change, but they do not cause line or paragraph breaks.
</para>
<para>
In practice, writers generally settle on the tagging of inline elements that
suits their time and subject matter. This may be a large number of
elements or only a handful. What is important is that you choose to mark up
not every possible item, but only those for which distinctive tagging will
be useful in the production of the finished document for the readers who
will search through it.
</para>
<para>
The following comprehensive list may be a useful tool for the process
of narrowing down the elements that you will choose to mark up; it is
not intended to overwhelm you by its sheer length. For convenience,
we've divided the inlines into several subcategories.
</para>
<para>
The classification used here is not meant to be authoritative, only
helpful in providing a feel for the nature of the inlines.  Several
elements appear in more than one category, and arguments could be made
to support the placement of additional elements in other categories or
entirely new categories.

The reference page or manual page in DocBook was inspired by, and in
fact designed to reproduce, the common <acronym>UNIX</acronym> “manpage”
concept. (We use the word "page" loosely here to mean a document of
variable length containing reference material on a specific topic.)
DocBook is rich in markup tailored for such documents, which often
vary greatly in content, however well-structured they may be. To
reflect both the structure and the variability of such texts, DocBook
specifies that reference pages have a strict sequence of parts, even
though several of them are actually optional.

</indexterm>The <tag class="element">info</tag> element contains

<tag class="element">refmeta</tag> contains a title for
the reference page (which may be inferred if the
<tag>refmeta</tag> element is not present) and an indication
of the volume number in which this reference page occurs. The
<tag>manvolnum</tag> is a very <acronym>UNIX</acronym>-centric concept.  In
traditional <acronym>UNIX</acronym> documentation, the subject of a reference page is
typically identified by name and volume number; this allows you to
distinguish between the <command>uname</command> command,
<quote>uname(1)</quote> in volume 1 of the documentation and the
<function>uname</function> function, <quote>uname(3)</quote> in
volume 3.

The first obligatory element is <tag class="element">refnamediv</tag>, which is a wrapper for
information about whatever you're documenting, rather than the
document itself. It can begin with a <tag class="element">refdescriptor</tag> if several items are being
documented as a group and the group has a name. The <tag class="element">refnamediv</tag> must contain at least one
<tag class="element">refname</tag>, that is, the name of
whatever you're documenting, and a single short statement that sums up
the use or function of the item(s) at a glance: their <tag class="element">refpurpose</tag>. Also available is the <tag class="element">refclass</tag>, intended to detail the
operating system configurations that the software element in question
supports.

A <tag class="element">refsynopsisdiv</tag> is intended
to provide a quick synopsis of the topic covered by the reference
page. For commands, this is generally a syntax summary of the command,
and for functions, the function prototype, but other options are
possible. A <tag class="element">title</tag> is allowed, but
not required, presumably because the application that processes
reference pages will generate the appropriate title if it is not
given. In traditional <acronym>UNIX</acronym> documentation, its title is always
“Synopsis”.

DocBook contains markup for the usual variety of front- and backmatter
necessary for books and articles: indexes, glossaries, bibliographies,
and tables of contents. In many cases, these components are generated
automatically, at least in part, from your document by an external
processor, but you can create them by hand, and in either case, store
them in DocBook.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>markup</primary>
  <secondary>backmatter, books and articles</secondary>
</indexterm>

Some forms of backmatter, like indexes and glossaries, usually require
additional markup <emphasis>in the document</emphasis> to make
generation by an application possible.  Bibliographies are usually
composed by hand like the rest of your text, unless you are
automatically selecting bibliographic entries out of some larger
database.  Our principal concern here is to acquaint you with the kind
of markup you need to include in your documents if you want to
construct these components.
</para>
<para>
Frontmatter, like the table of contents, is almost always generated
automatically from the text of a document by the processing
application. If you need information about how to mark up a table of
contents in DocBook, please consult the reference page for

</indexterm>
In some highly-structured documents such as reference manuals, you can
automate the whole process of generating an index successfully without
altering or adding to the original source. You can design a processing
application to select the information and compile it into an adequate
index. But this is rare.
</para>
<para>
In most cases—and even in the case of some reference
manuals—a useful index still requires human intervention to mark
occurrences of words or concepts that will appear in the text of the
index.

Docbook distinguishes two kinds of index markers: those that are
singular and result in a single page entry in the index itself, and
those that are multiple and refer to a range of pages.

<para>You put a singular index marker where the subject it refers to

</indexterm>
This index term has two levels, <tag>primary</tag> and
<tag>secondary</tag>.  They correspond to an increasing amount
of indented text in the resultant index. DocBook allows for three
levels of index terms, with the third labeled
<tag>tertiary</tag>.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>starting index terms (ranges)</primary>
</indexterm><indexterm>
  <primary>ending index terms (ranges)</primary>
</indexterm>

There are two ways that you can index a range of text. The first is to
put index marks at both the beginning and end of the discussion.  The
mark at the beginning asserts that it is the start of a range, and the
mark at the end refers back to the beginning. In this way, the
processing application can determine what range of text is
indexed. Here's the previous tiger example recast as starting and
ending index terms:
</para>

is a very large cat indeed…
&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;
So much for tigers&lt;indexterm startref="tiger-desc" class="endofrange"/&gt;.
Let's talk about leopards.  
&lt;/para&gt;
</screen>
<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>ID attribute</primary>
  <secondary>index entries, ranges</secondary>
</indexterm><indexterm>
  <primary>Class attribute</primary>
  <secondary>index entries, ranges</secondary>
</indexterm>

Note that the mark at the start of the range identifies itself as the
start of a range with the <tag class="attribute">class</tag>
attribute, and provides an <tag class="attribute">id</tag>.
The mark at the end of the range points back to the start.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>IndexTerm element</primary>
  <secondary>Zone attribute</secondary>
</indexterm><indexterm>
  <primary>Zone attribute (indexterm)</primary>
</indexterm>

Another way to mark up a range of text is to specify that the entire
content of an element, such as a chapter or section, is the complete
range.  In this case, all you need is for the index term to point to
the <tag class="attribute">id</tag> of the element that
contains the content in question. The <tag class="attribute">zone</tag> attribute of <tag>indexterm</tag>
provides this functionality.
</para>
<para>
One of the interesting features of this method is that the actual
index marks do not have to occur anywhere near the text being
indexed. It is possible to collect all of them together, for example,
in one file, but it is not invalid to have the index marker occur near
the element it indexes.
</para>
<para>
Suppose the discussion of tigers in your document comprises a
whole text object (like a <tag class="element">sect1</tag>
or a <tag class="element">chapter</tag>) with an
<tag class="attribute">id</tag> value of 
<literal>tiger-desc</literal>. You can put the following
tag anywhere in your document to index that range of text:
<screen>
&lt;indexterm zone="tiger-desc"&gt;
&lt;primary&gt;Big Cats&lt;/primary&gt;
&lt;secondary&gt;Tigers&lt;/secondary&gt;&lt;/indexterm&gt;
</screen> 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>see and see also index entries</primary>
</indexterm>
DocBook also contains markup for index hits that point to other index
hits (of the same type such as "See Cats, big" or "See also
Lions"). See the reference pages for <tag>see</tag> and
<tag>seealso</tag>.
</para>

<section xml:id="s.printindex">
<title>Printing an index</title>

<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>indexes</primary>
  <secondary>printing</secondary>
</indexterm>

After you have added the appropriate markup to your document, an
external application can use this information to build an index. The
resulting index must have information about the page numbers on which
the concepts appear. It's usually the document formatter that builds
the index.  In this case, it may never be instantiated in DocBook.
</para>
<para>

  <primary>indexes</primary>
  <secondary>index marked up in DocBook (example)</secondary>
</indexterm>

However, there are applications that can produce an index marked up in
DocBook.  The following example includes some one- and two-level
<tag class="element">indexentry</tag> elements (which
correspond to the primary and secondary levels in the
<tag>indexterm</tag>s themselves) that begin with the letter D:

<screen>&lt;index&gt;&lt;title&gt;Index&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;indexdiv&gt;&lt;title&gt;D&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;indexentry&gt;
  &lt;primaryie&gt;database (bibliographic), 253, 255&lt;/primaryie&gt;
     &lt;secondaryie&gt;structure, 255&lt;/secondaryie&gt;
     &lt;secondaryie&gt;tools, 259&lt;/secondaryie&gt;
&lt;/indexentry&gt;
&lt;indexentry&gt;
  &lt;primaryie&gt;dates (language specific), 179&lt;/primaryie&gt;
&lt;/indexentry&gt;
&lt;indexentry&gt;
  &lt;primaryie&gt;DC fonts, &lt;emphasis&gt;172&lt;/emphasis&gt;, 177&lt;/primaryie&gt;
     &lt;secondaryie&gt;Math fonts, 177&lt;/secondaryie&gt;
&lt;/indexentry&gt;
&lt;/indexdiv&gt;
&lt;/index&gt;
</screen> 
</para>

<para>The structure of <tag>indexentry</tag> is parallel to the structure
of <tag>indexterm</tag>. Where <tag>indexterm</tag> has
<tag>primary</tag>, <tag>secondary</tag>, <tag>tertiary</tag>,

<tag>indexentry</tag>, has

<tag>glossary</tag>s, like <tag>bibliography</tag>s, are often
constructed by hand.  However, some applications are capable of
building a skeletal index from glossary term markup in the document.
If all of your terms are defined in some glossary database, it may
even be possible to construct the complete glossary automatically.

</indexterm>

To enable automatic glossary generation, or simply automatic linking
from glossary terms in the text to glossary entries, you must add
markup to your documents.  In the text, you markup a term for
compilation later with the inline <tag>glossterm</tag>
tag. This tag can have a <tag class="attribute">linkend</tag>
attribute whose value is the ID of the actual entry in the
glossary.<footnote>
<para>
Some sophisticated formatters might even be able to establish the link
simply by examining the content of the terms and the glossary. In that
case, the author is not required to make explicit links.
</para>
</footnote>
</para>
<para>
For instance, if you have this markup in your document:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;glossterm linkend="xml"&gt;Extensible Markup Language&lt;/glossterm&gt; is a new standard… 
</screen>
<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>glossaries</primary>
  <secondary>example</secondary>
</indexterm>

your glossary might look like this:
</para>

<screen>&lt;glossary&gt;&lt;title&gt;Example Glossary&lt;/title&gt;
⋮
&lt;glossdiv&gt;&lt;title&gt;E&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;glossentry id="xml"&gt;&lt;glossterm&gt;Extensible Markup Language&lt;/glossterm&gt;
  &lt;acronym&gt;XML&lt;/acronym&gt;
&lt;glossdef&gt;
  &lt;para&gt;Some reasonable definition here.&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;glossseealso otherterm="sgml"&gt;
&lt;/glossdef&gt;
&lt;/glossentry&gt;

&lt;/glossdiv&gt;
</screen>
<para>
Note that the <tag class="element">glossterm</tag> tag
reappears in the glossary to mark up the term and distinguish it from
its definition within the <tag class="element">glossentry</tag>.
The <tag class="attribute">id</tag> that
the <tag class="element">glossentry</tag> referenced in the
text is the <acronym>ID</acronym> of the <tag class="element">glossentry</tag> in the <tag>glossary</tag>
itself. You can use the link between source and glossary to create a
link in the online form of your document, as we have done with the
online form of the glossary in this book.

There are two ways to set up a bibliography in DocBook: you can have
the data <emphasis>raw</emphasis> or
<emphasis>cooked</emphasis>. Here's an example of a raw
bibliographical item, wrapped in the <tag class="element">biblioentry</tag> element:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;biblioentry xreflabel="Kites75"&gt;
  &lt;authorgroup&gt;
    &lt;author&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;Andrea&lt;/firstname&gt;&lt;surname&gt;Bahadur&lt;/surname&gt;&lt;/author&gt;
    &lt;author&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;Mark&lt;/firstname&gt;&lt;surname&gt;Shwarek&lt;/surname&gt;&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;/authorgroup&gt;
  &lt;copyright&gt;&lt;year&gt;1974&lt;/year&gt;&lt;year&gt;1975&lt;/year&gt;
     &lt;holder&gt;Product Development International Holding N. V.&lt;/holder&gt;
     &lt;/copyright&gt;
  &lt;isbn&gt;0-88459-021-6&lt;/isbn&gt;    
  &lt;publisher&gt;
    &lt;publishername&gt;Plenary Publications International, Inc.&lt;/publishername&gt;
  &lt;/publisher&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Kites&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;subtitle&gt;Ancient Craft to Modern Sport&lt;/subtitle&gt;
  &lt;pagenums&gt;988-999&lt;/pagenums&gt;
  &lt;seriesinfo&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The Family Creative Workshop&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;seriesvolnums&gt;1-22&lt;/seriesvolnums&gt;
    &lt;editor&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Allen&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;othername role=middle&gt;Davenport&lt;/othername&gt;
      &lt;surname&gt;Bragdon&lt;/surname&gt;
      &lt;contrib&gt;Editor in Chief&lt;/contrib&gt;
    &lt;/editor&gt;
  &lt;/seriesinfo&gt;
&lt;/biblioentry&gt;
</screen>
<para>
The “raw” data in a <tag class="element">biblioentry</tag> is comprehensive to a
fault—there are enough fields to suit a host of different
bibliographical styles, and that is the point. An abundance of data
requires processing applications to select, punctuate, order, and
format the bibliographical data, and it is unlikely that all the
information provided will actually be output.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm>
  <primary>Bibliomixed element</primary>
</indexterm>

All the “cooked” data in a <tag class="element">bibliomixed</tag> entry in a bibliography, on the
other hand, is intended to be presented to the reader in the form and
sequence in which it is provided. It even includes punctuation between
the fields of data:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;bibliomixed&gt;
  &lt;bibliomset relation=article&gt;
    &lt;surname&gt;Walsh&lt;/surname&gt;, &lt;firstname&gt;Norman&lt;/firstname&gt;.
    &lt;title role=article&gt;Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets&lt;/title&gt;.
  &lt;/bibliomset&gt;
  &lt;bibliomset relation=journal&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The World Wide Web Journal&lt;/title&gt; 
    &lt;volumenum&gt;2&lt;/volumenum&gt;&lt;issuenum&gt;1&lt;/issuenum&gt;.
    &lt;publishername&gt;O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;/publishername&gt; and
    &lt;corpname&gt;The World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/corpname&gt;.
    &lt;pubdate&gt;Winter, 1996&lt;/pubdate&gt;&lt;/bibliomset&gt;.
&lt;/bibliomixed&gt;
</screen>

<para>Clearly, these two ways of marking up bibliographical entries are
suited to different circumstances.  You should use one or the other
for your bibliography, not both. Strictly speaking, mingling the raw
and the cooked may be “kosher” as far as the <acronym>DTD</acronym> is
concerned, but it will almost certainly cause problems for most
processing applications.
