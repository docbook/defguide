<title>Description</title>


<para><tag>Title</tag> is widely used in DocBook. It identifies the
titles of documents and parts of documents, and is the required
caption on formal objects.  It is also allowed as an optional
title or caption on many additional block elements.
</para>

<refsection xml:id="dbreproc.title"><title>Processing expectations</title>
<para><?tdg gentext='format.block'?>
Titles are often repeated in several locations,
for example, at the location where the object occurs, in the
<emphasis>table of contents</emphasis>, and in running headers and
footers.
</para>
<para>DocBook does not offer any mechanism for indicating where a line
break should occur in long titles.  Titles are often repeated
and no single line break is likely to be correct in all of the
places where a title is used. Instead, you will have to rely on
your processing system to provide a mechanism, such as a
processing instruction, for identifing the location of forced
line breaks.
