</indexterm>This chapter explains in concrete, practical terms how to
make DocBook documents. It's an overview of all the kinds of markup
that are possible in DocBook documents. It explains how to create
several kinds of DocBook documents: books, sets of books, chapters,
articles, and reference manual entries. The idea is to give you enough
basic information to actually start writing. The information here is
intentionally skeletal; you can find &ldquo;the details&rdquo; in the
reference section of this book.
</para>
<para>
Before we can examine DocBook markup, we have to take a look at what
an &SGML; or &XML; system requires.

&SGML; documents begin with an optional &SGML; Declaration. The
declaration can precede the document instance, but generally it is
stored in a separate file that is associated with the &DTD;. The
&SGML; Declaration is a grab bag of &SGML; defaults. DocBook includes
an &SGML; Declaration that is appropriate for most DocBook documents,
so we won't go into a lot of detail here about the &SGML; Declaration.

In brief, the &SGML; Declaration describes, among other things, what
characters are markup delimiters (the default is angle brackets), what
characters can compose tag and attribute names (usually the
alphabetical and numeric characters plus the dash and the period),
what characters can legally occur within your document, how long
&SGML; &ldquo;names&rdquo; and &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; can be, what sort
of minimizations (abbreviation of markup) are allowed, and so
on. Changing the &SGML; Declaration is rarely necessary, and because
many tools only partially support changes to the declaration, changing
it is best avoided, if possible.

All &SGML; documents must begin with a document type declaration. This
identifies the &DTD; that will be used by the document and what the
root element of the document will be. A typical doctype declaration
for a DocBook document looks like this:
</para>
<screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN"></screen>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>root element</primary>
  <secondary>document type declaration</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>elements</primary>
  <secondary>root element</secondary></indexterm>
This declaration indicates that the <firstterm>root element</firstterm>,
which is the first element in the hierarchical structure of the
document, will be <sgmltag class="starttag">book</sgmltag> and that
the &DTD; used will be the one identified by the public identifier
<literal>-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN</literal>. See <xref linkend="ch.create.pubids"/>&rdquo; later in this chapter.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>An Internal Subset</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>internal subset</primary>
  <secondary>SGML document declarations</secondary></indexterm>

It's also possible to provide additional declarations in a document
by placing them in the document type declaration:</para>
<screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN" [
&lt;!ENTITY nwalsh "Norman Walsh">
&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.sgm">
&lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM "chap2.sgm">

<indexterm><primary>public identifiers</primary>
  <secondary>SGML</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>system identifiers</primary>
  <secondary>SGML</secondary></indexterm>

These declarations form what is known as the
<firstterm>internal subset</firstterm>. The declarations stored in the
file referenced by the public or system identifier in the 
<literal>DOCTYPE</literal> declaration is called the <firstterm>external
subset</firstterm> and it is technically optional.
It is legal to put the &DTD; in the internal
subset and to have no external subset, but for a &DTD; as large
as DocBook that wouldn't make much sense.
</para>

<note>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>parsing</primary>
  <secondary>order</secondary></indexterm>
The internal subset is parsed <emphasis>first</emphasis>
and, if multiple declarations for an entity occur, the first
declaration is used.  Declarations in the internal subset
override declarations in the external subset.</para>

  <secondary>root element</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>root element</primary>
  <secondary>placement</secondary></indexterm>

Although comments and processing instructions may occur between the
document type declaration and the root element, the root element usually
immediately follows the document type declaration:</para>
<screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN" [
&lt;!ENTITY nwalsh "Norman Walsh">
&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.sgm">
&lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM "chap2.sgm">

&lt;book>
&amp;chap1;
&amp;chap2;
&lt;/book></screen>
<para>You cannot place the root element of
the document in an external entity.</para>

Many of these things are influenced by the &SGML; declaration in use.

Several forms of markup minimization are allowed, including empty
tags. Instead of typing the entire end tag for an element, you can
type simply <literal>&lt;/></literal>. For example:
</para>
<screen>
<![CDATA[
<para>
This is <emphasis>important</>: never stick the tines of a fork
in an electrical outlet.
</para>
]]>
</screen>
<para>
You can use this technique for any and every tag, but it will make
your documents very hard to understand and difficult to debug if you 
introduce errors.  It is best to use this technique
only for inline elements containing a short string of text.

Empty start tags are also possible, but may be even more confusing.
For the record, if you encounter an empty start tag, the &SGML; parser uses
the element that ended last:
</para>
<screen>
<![CDATA[
<para>
This is <emphasis>important</emphasis>.  So is <>this</emphasis>.

Although we've made a point of reminding you about which of these

documents might be.)

<screen>&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?></screen>
<para>Identifying the version of &XML; ensures that future changes to
the &XML; specification will not alter the semantics of this
document. The standalone declaration simply makes explicit the fact
that this document cannot &ldquo;stand alone,&rdquo; and that it
relies on an external &DTD;. The complete details of the &XML;

Conceptually, almost everything in this book applies equally to &SGML;

tend to use &SGML; conventions in our writing.  If you're primarily

When a &DTD; or other external file is referenced from a document, the

both. In &XML;, the system identifier is <emphasis>generally</emphasis> 
required and the public identifier is optional. In &SGML;, neither is 
required, but at least one must be present.<footnote>

the reference could be implied by the application, but this is very
rarely the case.

  <secondary>XML system identifiers, future</secondary></indexterm>
The introduction of &XML; has added some small complications to system
identifiers.  In &SGML;, a system identifier generally points to a
single, local version of a file using local system conventions. In
&XML;, it must point with a Uniform Resource Indicator
(<acronym>URI</acronym>). The most common <acronym>URI</acronym>
today is the Uniform Resource Locator (<acronym>URL</acronym>), which
is familiar to anyone who browses the Web.  <acronym>URL</acronym>s
are a lot like &SGML; system identifiers, because they generally point
to a single version of a file on a particular machine.  In the future,
Uniform Resource Names (<acronym>URN</acronym>), another form of
<acronym>URI</acronym>, will allow &XML; system identifiers to have
the abstract characteristics of public identifiers.

The following filename is an example of an &SGML; system identifier:
<screen>/usr/local/sgml/docbook/3.1/docbook.dtd
</screen>
An equivalent &XML; system identifier might be:
<screen>file:///usr/local/sgml/docbook/3.1/docbook.dtd
</screen>
</para>
<para>
The advantage of using the public identifier is that it makes your
documents more portable. For any system on which DocBook is installed,
the public identifier will resolve to the appropriate local version of
the &DTD; (if public identifiers can be resolved at all).
</para>
<para>
Public identifiers have two disadvantages:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Because &XML; does not require them, and because system

Public identifiers aren't magical. They're simply a method of

<ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/"><acronym>OASIS</acronym></ulink>)
described a standard mechanism for mapping public identifiers to
system identifers using catalog files.</para>

An important characteristic of public identifiers is that they are
<emphasis>globally unique</emphasis>. Referring to a document with a
public identifier should mean that the identifier will resolve to the
same actual document on any system even though the location of that
document on each system may vary.  As a rule, you should never reuse
public identifiers, and a published revision should have a new public
identifier. Not following these rules defeats one purpose of the
public identifier.

A public identifier can be any string of upper- and lowercase letters,

The <ulink url="http://www.gca.org/">Graphics Communication
Association</ulink> (<acronym>GCA</acronym>) can assign registered
public identifiers.  They do this by issuing the applicant a unique
string and declaring the format of the owner identifier. For example,
the Davenport Group was issued the string &ldquo;A00002&rdquo; and
could have published DocBook using an <acronym>FPI</acronym> of the

+//IDN oreilly.com//<replaceable>...</replaceable>
</screen>

As of DocBook V3.1, the <acronym>OASIS</acronym> Technical Committee

  <secondary>XML system identifiers</secondary></indexterm>
System identifiers are usually filenames on the local system. In

identifiers must be <acronym>URI</acronym>s (Uniform Resource
Identifiers).
</para>
<para>
The use of <acronym>URI</acronym>s as system identifiers introduces
the possibility that a system identifier can be a
<acronym>URN</acronym>. This allows the system identifier to benefit
from the same global uniqueness benefit as the public identifier. It
seems likely that &XML; system identifiers will eventually move in
this direction.

<firstterm>Catalog files</firstterm> are the standard mechanism for

<acronym>OASIS</acronym> Technical Resolution 9401:1997.
</para>
<para>
Informally, a catalog is a text file that contains a number of
keyword/value pairs. The most frequently used keywords are
<literal>PUBLIC</literal>, <literal>SYSTEM</literal>,

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><literal>PUBLIC</literal></term>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>PUBLIC keyword</primary></indexterm>

The <literal>PUBLIC</literal> keyword maps public identifiers to

    "docbook/xml/1.3/db3xml.dtd"

<varlistentry><term><literal>SGMLDECL</literal></term>
<listitem>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>DTDDECL</primary></indexterm>

Like <literal>SGMLDECL</literal>, <literal>DTDDECL</literal>
identifies the &SGML; Declaration that should be
used. <literal>DTDDECL</literal> associates a declaration with a
particular public identifier for a &DTD;:
</para>
<screen>DTDDECL "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN" "docbook/3.1/docbook.dcl"
</screen>
<para>Unfortunately, it is not supported by the free tools that are

</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><literal>CATALOG</literal></term>
<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>CATALOG keyword</primary></indexterm>

The <literal>CATALOG</literal> keyword allows one catalog to
include the content of another.  This can make maintenance somewhat
easier and allows a system to directly use the catalog files included
in &DTD; distributions. For example, the DocBook distribution includes
a catalog file. Rather than copying each of the declarations in that
catalog into your system catalog, you can simply include the contents
of the DocBook catalog:

<screen>CATALOG "docbook/3.1/catalog"</screen>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><literal>OVERRIDE</literal></term>
<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>OVERRIDE keyword</primary></indexterm>

The <literal>OVERRIDE</literal> keyword indicates whether or not
public identifiers override system identifiers. If a given declaration
includes both a system identifer and a public identifier, most systems
attempt to process the document referenced by the system identifier,
and consequently ignore the public identifier. Specifying
<screen>OVERRIDE YES</screen> in the catalog informs the processing
system that resolution should be attempted first with the public
identifier.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><literal>DELEGATE</literal></term>
<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>DELEGATE keyword</primary></indexterm>

The <literal>DELEGATE</literal> keyword allows you to specify
that some set of public identifiers should be resolved by another
catalog. Unlike the <literal>CATALOG</literal> keyword, which loads
the referenced catalog, <literal>DELEGATE</literal> does nothing until
an attempt is made to resolve a public identifier.</para> <para>The
<literal>DELEGATE</literal> entry specifies a partial public
identifier and an alternate catalog:
<screen>DELEGATE "-//OASIS" "/usr/sgml/oasis/catalog"</screen>
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>initial substring matches (public identifiers)</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>public identifiers</primary>
  <secondary>partial (initial substring matches)</secondary></indexterm>

Partial public identifers are simply initial substring
matches. Given the preceding entry, if an attempt is made to match any
public identifier that begins with the string
<literal>-//OASIS</literal>, the alternate catalog
<filename>/usr/sgml/oasis/catalog</filename> will be used&nbsp;instead
of the current catalog.

The <literal>DOCTYPE</literal> keyword allows you to specify a default
system identifier.  If an &SGML; document begins with a
<literal>DOCTYPE</literal> declaration that specifies neither a public
identifier nor a system identifier (or is missing a

Catalog files go a long way towards making documents more portable by
introducing a level of indirection. A problem still remains, however:
how does a processor locate the appropriate catalog file(s)?
<acronym>OASIS</acronym> outlines a complete interchange packaging
scheme, but for most applications the answer is simply that the
processor looks for a file called <filename>catalog</filename> or
<filename>CATALOG</filename>.

Some applications allow you to specify a list of directories that
should be examined for catalog files. Other tools allow you to specify
the actual files.
</para>
<para>
Note that even if a list of directories or catalog files is provided,
applications may still load catalog files that occur in directories in
which other documents are found. For example, <acronym>SP</acronym>
and Jade always load the catalog file that occurs in the directory in
which a &DTD; or document resides, even if that directory is not on
the catalog file list.

  <secondary>documents (DocBook)</secondary></indexterm>
The rest of this chapter describes how you can break documents into
logical chunks, such as books, chapters, sections, and so on. Before
we begin, and while the subject of the internal subset is fresh in
your mind, let's take a quick look at how to break documents into
separate physical chunks.
</para>
<para>
Actually, we've already told you how to do it. If you recall, in the
preceding sections we had declarations of the form:
<screen>&lt;!ENTITY <replaceable>name</replaceable> SYSTEM "<replaceable>filename</replaceable>">
</screen>
<indexterm><primary>entities</primary>
  <secondary>inserting files</secondary></indexterm>

If you refer to the entity <replaceable>name</replaceable> in your
document after this declaration, the system will insert the contents
of the file <replaceable>filename</replaceable> into your document at that
point.  So, if you've got a book that consists of three chapters and
two appendixes, you might create a file called
<filename>book.sgm</filename>, which looks like this:
</para>
<screen>&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN" [
&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.sgm">
&lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM "chap2.sgm">
&lt;!ENTITY chap3 SYSTEM "chap3.sgm">
&lt;!ENTITY appa SYSTEM "appa.sgm">
&lt;!ENTITY appb SYSTEM "appb.sgm">
]>
&lt;book>&lt;title>My First Book&lt;/title>
&amp;chap1;
&amp;chap2;
&amp;chap3;
&amp;appa;
&amp;appb;
&lt;/book>
</screen>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>declarations</primary>
  <secondary>document type declaration</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>document type declaration</primary>
  <secondary>divisions of documents</secondary></indexterm>

You can then write the chapters and appendixes conveniently in
separate files.  Note that these files do not and must not have
document type declarations.
</para>
<para>
For example, Chapter 1 might begin like this:
</para>
<screen>
<![CDATA[
<chapter id="ch1"><title>My First Chapter</title>
<para>My first paragraph.</para>
...
]]>
</screen>
<para>
But it should not begin with its own document type declaration:
</para>
<screen>
<![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE chapter PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN">
<chapter id="ch1"><title>My First Chapter</title>
<para>My first paragraph.</para>

DocBook elements can be divided broadly into these categories:
<simplelist type="vert">
<member>Sets</member>
<member>Books</member>

In the rest of this section, we'll describe briefly the elements that
make up these categories.  This section is designed to give you an
overview. It is not an exhaustive list of every element in DocBook.

<title>Sets</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Sets</primary></indexterm>

A <sgmltag>Set</sgmltag> contains two or more
<sgmltag>Book</sgmltag>s.  It's the hierarchical top of DocBook. You
use the <sgmltag>Set</sgmltag> tag, for example, for a series of books
on a single subject that you want to access and maintain as a single
unit, such as the manuals for an airplane engine or the documentation
for a programming language.

  <secondary>elements, ordering</secondary></indexterm>
A <sgmltag>Book</sgmltag> is probably the most common top-level
element in a document. The DocBook definition of a book is very loose
and general. Given the variety of books authored with DocBook and the
number of different conventions for book organization used in
countries around the world, attempting to impose a strict ordering of
elements can make the content model extremely complex.  But DocBook
gives you free reign.  It's very reasonable to use a local <link linkend="app-customizing">customization layer</link> to impose a more
strict ordering for your applications.
</para>
<para>
<sgmltag>Book</sgmltag>s consist of a mixture of the following elements:
</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Dedication</term>

There are a few component-level elements designed for
navigation: <sgmltag>ToC</sgmltag>, for Tables of Contents;
<sgmltag>LoT</sgmltag>, for Lists of Titles (for lists of figures,

Divisions are the first hierarchical level below <sgmltag>Book</sgmltag>.
They contain <sgmltag>Part</sgmltag>s and <sgmltag>Reference</sgmltag>s.
<sgmltag>Part</sgmltag>s, in turn, contain components.

There are several flavors of sectioning elements in DocBook:</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><sgmltag>Sect1</sgmltag>&hellip;<sgmltag>Sect5</sgmltag> elements</term>
<listitem>
<para>The <sgmltag>Sect1</sgmltag>&hellip;<sgmltag>Sect5</sgmltag>
elements are the most common sectioning elements. They can occur in
most component-level elements. These numbered section elements must be
properly nested (<sgmltag>Sect2</sgmltag>s can only occur inside
<sgmltag>Sect1</sgmltag>s, <sgmltag>Sect3</sgmltag>s can only occur inside
<sgmltag>Sect2</sgmltag>s, and so on).  There are five levels of numbered
sections.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><sgmltag>Section</sgmltag> element</term>
<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Section element</primary></indexterm>

The <sgmltag>Section</sgmltag> element, introduced in DocBook V3.1, is
an alternative to numbered sections.  <sgmltag>Section</sgmltag>s are
recursive, meaning that you can nest them to any depth desired.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><sgmltag>SimpleSect</sgmltag> element</term>
<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>SimpleSect element</primary></indexterm>

In addition to numbered sections, there's the
<sgmltag>SimpleSect</sgmltag> element.  It is a terminal section that
can occur at any level, but it cannot have any other sectioning
element nested within it.</para>
</listitem>

<varlistentry><term><sgmltag>BridgeHead</sgmltag></term>

<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>RefEntry element</primary></indexterm>
These elements, which occur only in <sgmltag>RefEntry</sgmltag>s, are
analogous to the numbered section elements in components.  There are
only three levels of numbered section elements in a
<sgmltag>RefEntry</sgmltag>.</para>

<sgmltag>Glossary</sgmltag>s, <sgmltag>Bibliography</sgmltag>s,

The meta-information wrapper is designed to contain bibliographic
information about the content (<sgmltag>Author</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>Title</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>Publisher</sgmltag>, and so on) as well as other meta-information
such as revision histories, keyword sets, and index terms.

<indexterm><primary>line-specific environments</primary></indexterm>

The block elements occur immediately below the component and
sectioning elements. These are the (roughly) paragraph-level elements
in DocBook. They can be divided into a number of categories: lists,
admonitions, line-specific environments, synopses of several sorts,
tables, figures, examples, and a dozen or more miscellaneous elements.

<para>
<indexterm><primary>block elements</primary>
  <secondary>inline elements vs.</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>inline elements</primary>
  <secondary>block elements vs.</secondary></indexterm>

At the paragraph-level, it's convenient to divide elements into two
classes, <firstterm>block</firstterm> and <firstterm>inline</firstterm>.
From a structural point of view, this distinction is based loosely on
their relative size, but it's easiest to describe the difference in
terms of their presentation.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>sidebars</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>block quotations</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>quotations (block)</primary></indexterm>
Block elements are usually presented with a paragraph (or larger)
break before and after them.  Most can contain other block elements,
and many can contain character data and inline elements. Paragraphs,
lists, sidebars, tables, and block quotations are all common examples
of block elements.

Inline elements are generally represented without any obvious breaks.
The most common distinguishing mark of inline elements is a font
change, but inline elements may present no visual distinction at all.
Inline elements contain character data and possibly other inline
elements, but they never contain block elements.  Inline elements are
used to mark up data such as cross references, filenames, commands,
options, subscripts and superscripts, and glossary terms.

<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>CallOut element</primary></indexterm>

<indexterm><primary>Note element</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Tip element</primary></indexterm>

There are five types of admonitions in DocBook:
<sgmltag>Caution</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>Important</sgmltag>,
<sgmltag>Note</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>Tip</sgmltag>, and
<sgmltag>Warning</sgmltag>.
</para>
<para>
All of the admonitions have the same structure: an optional <sgmltag>
Title</sgmltag> followed by paragraph-level elements. The DocBook
&DTD; does not impose any specific semantics on the individual
admonitions. For example, DocBook does not mandate that
<sgmltag>Warning</sgmltag>s be reserved for cases where bodily harm
can result.

These environments preserve whitespace and line breaks in the source
text. DocBook does not provide the equivalent of &HTML;'s
<sgmltag>BR</sgmltag> tag, so there's no way to interject a line break
into normal running text.
</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><sgmltag>Address</sgmltag></term>
<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Address element</primary></indexterm>

The <sgmltag>Address</sgmltag> element is intended for postal

<indexterm><primary>LiteralLayout element</primary></indexterm>

A <sgmltag>LiteralLayout</sgmltag> does not have any semantic
association beyond the preservation of whitespace and line breaks.  In
particular, while <sgmltag>ProgramListing</sgmltag> and
<sgmltag>Screen</sgmltag> are frequently presented in a fixed-width
font, a change of fonts is not necessarily implied by <sgmltag>LiteralLayout

<sgmltag>InformalFigure</sgmltag> element was introduced in DocBook
<acronym>V3.1</acronym>. In prior versions of DocBook, you could only
achieve the effect of an informal figure by placing its content,
unwrapped, at the location where the informal figure was desired.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>Paragraphs</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Para element</primary></indexterm>

There are three paragraph elements: <sgmltag>Para</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>
SimPara</sgmltag> (simple paragraphs may not contain other block-level
elements), and <sgmltag>FormalPara</sgmltag> (formal paragraphs have
titles).
</para>

<sect3><title>Equations</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Equation element</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>titles</primary>
  <secondary>equation elements</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>InlineEquation element</primary></indexterm>
There are two block-equation elements, <sgmltag>Equation</sgmltag> and
<sgmltag>InformalEquation</sgmltag> (for inline equations, use
<sgmltag>InlineEquation</sgmltag>).
</para>
<para>
Informal equations don't have titles. For reasons of
backward-compatibility, <sgmltag>Equation</sgmltag>s are not required
to have titles. However, it may be more difficult for some stylesheet
languages to properly enumerate <sgmltag>Equation</sgmltag>s if they
lack titles.

<indexterm><primary>ScreenShot element</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>block elements</primary>
  <secondary>Graphic</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>InlineGraphic element</primary></indexterm>

Graphics occur most frequently in <sgmltag>Figure</sgmltag>s and
<sgmltag>ScreenShot</sgmltag>s, but they can also occur without a
wrapper. DocBook considers a <sgmltag>Graphic</sgmltag> a block
element, even if it appears to occur inline. For graphics that you
want to be represented inline, use <sgmltag>InlineGraphic</sgmltag>.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>MediaObject elements</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>InlineMediaObject element</primary></indexterm>

DocBook <acronym>V3.1</acronym> introduced a new element to contain
graphics and other media types: <sgmltag>MediaObject</sgmltag> and its inline
cousin, <sgmltag>InlineMediaObject</sgmltag>. These elements may contain
video, audio, image, and text data. A single media object can contain
several alternative forms from which the presentation system can
select the most appropriate object.

DocBook <acronym>V3.1</acronym> introduced the <sgmltag>QandASet</sgmltag>
element, which is suitable for <acronym>FAQ</acronym>s (Frequently
Asked Questions) and other similar collections of
<sgmltag>Question</sgmltag>s and <sgmltag>Answer</sgmltag>s.

  <secondary>inline elements</secondary></indexterm>

Users of DocBook are provided with a surfeit of inline elements.
Inline elements are used to mark up running text.  In published
documents, inline elements often cause a font change or other small
change, but they do not cause line or paragraph breaks.
</para>
<para>
In practice, writers generally settle on the tagging of inline elements that
suits their time and subject matter. This may be a large number of
elements or only a handful. What is important is that you choose to mark up
not every possible item, but only those for which distinctive tagging will
be useful in the production of the finished document for the readers who
will search through it.
</para>
<para>
The following comprehensive list may be a useful tool for the process
of narrowing down the elements that you will choose to mark up; it is
not intended to overwhelm you by its sheer length. For convenience,
we've divided the inlines into several subcategories.
</para>
<para>
The classification used here is not meant to be authoritative, only
helpful in providing a feel for the nature of the inlines.  Several
elements appear in more than one category, and arguments could be made
to support the placement of additional elements in other categories or
entirely new categories.

DocBook does not define a complete set of elements for representing
equations.  No one has ever pressed the DocBook maintainers to add
this functionality, and the prevailing opinion is that incorporating
<ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/">MathML</ulink> using a
mechanism like <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">namespaces</ulink> is probably
the best long-term solution.

<indexterm><primary>manpage (UNIX)</primary></indexterm>

The reference page or manual page in DocBook was inspired by, and in
fact designed to reproduce, the common &UNIX; &ldquo;manpage&rdquo;
concept. (We use the word "page" loosely here to mean a document of
variable length containing reference material on a specific topic.)
DocBook is rich in markup tailored for such documents, which often
vary greatly in content, however well-structured they may be. To
reflect both the structure and the variability of such texts, DocBook
specifies that reference pages have a strict sequence of parts, even
though several of them are actually optional.

Of the following sequence of elements that may appear in a <sgmltag class="element">RefEntry</sgmltag>, only two are obligatory: <sgmltag class="element">RefNameDiv</sgmltag> and <sgmltag class="element">RefSect1</sgmltag>.

The <sgmltag class="element">DocInfo</sgmltag> element contains
meta-information about the reference page (which should not be
confused with <sgmltag class="element">RefMeta</sgmltag>, which it
precedes). It marks up information about the author of the document,
or the product to which it pertains, or the document's revision
history, or other such information.</para>

<sgmltag class="element">RefMeta</sgmltag> contains a title for
the reference page (which may be inferred if the
<sgmltag>RefMeta</sgmltag> element is not present) and an indication
of the volume number in which this reference page occurs. The
<sgmltag>ManVolNum</sgmltag> is a very &UNIX;-centric concept.  In
traditional &UNIX; documentation, the subject of a reference page is
typically identified by name and volume number; this allows you to
distinguish between the <command>uname</command> command,
<quote>uname(1)</quote> in volume 1 of the documentation and the
<function>uname</function> function, <quote>uname(3)</quote> in
volume 3.

The first obligatory element is <sgmltag class="element">RefNameDiv</sgmltag>, which is a wrapper for
information about whatever you're documenting, rather than the
document itself. It can begin with a <sgmltag class="element">RefDescriptor</sgmltag> if several items are being
documented as a group and the group has a name. The <sgmltag class="element">RefNameDiv</sgmltag> must contain at least one
<sgmltag class="element">RefName</sgmltag>, that is, the name of
whatever you're documenting, and a single short statement that sums up
the use or function of the item(s) at a glance: their <sgmltag class="element">RefPurpose</sgmltag>. Also available is the <sgmltag class="element">RefClass</sgmltag>, intended to detail the
operating system configurations that the software element in question
supports.

A <sgmltag class="element">RefSynopsisDiv</sgmltag> is intended
to provide a quick synopsis of the topic covered by the reference
page. For commands, this is generally a syntax summary of the command,
and for functions, the function prototype, but other options are
possible. A <sgmltag class="element">Title</sgmltag> is allowed, but
not required, presumably because the application that processes
reference pages will generate the appropriate title if it is not
given. In traditional &UNIX; documentation, its title is always
&ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo;.

DocBook contains markup for the usual variety of front- and backmatter
necessary for books and articles: indexes, glossaries, bibliographies,
and tables of contents. In many cases, these components are generated
automatically, at least in part, from your document by an external
processor, but you can create them by hand, and in either case, store
them in DocBook.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>markup</primary>
  <secondary>backmatter, books and articles</secondary></indexterm>

Some forms of backmatter, like indexes and glossaries, usually require
additional markup <emphasis>in the document</emphasis> to make
generation by an application possible.  Bibliographies are usually
composed by hand like the rest of your text, unless you are
automatically selecting bibliographic entries out of some larger
database.  Our principal concern here is to acquaint you with the kind
of markup you need to include in your documents if you want to
construct these components.
</para>
<para>
Frontmatter, like the table of contents, is almost always generated
automatically from the text of a document by the processing
application. If you need information about how to mark up a table of
contents in DocBook, please consult the reference page for
<sgmltag>ToC</sgmltag>.

  <secondary>marking index terms</secondary></indexterm>
In some highly-structured documents such as reference manuals, you can
automate the whole process of generating an index successfully without
altering or adding to the original source. You can design a processing
application to select the information and compile it into an adequate
index. But this is rare.
</para>
<para>
In most cases&mdash;and even in the case of some reference
manuals&mdash;a useful index still requires human intervention to mark
occurrences of words or concepts that will appear in the text of the
index.
</para>
<sect3><title>Marking index terms</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>singular index markers</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>ranges, index entries</primary></indexterm>

Docbook distinguishes two kinds of index markers: those that are
singular and result in a single page entry in the index itself, and
those that are multiple and refer to a range of pages.
</para>
<para>You put a singular index marker where the subject it refers to
actually occurs in your text:
<screen>
&lt;para>
The tiger&lt;indexterm>
&lt;primary>Big Cats&lt;/primary>
&lt;secondary>Tigers&lt;/secondary>&lt;/indexterm>
is a very large cat indeed.
&lt;/para>
</screen> 
<indexterm><primary>primary level index entries</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>secondary level index entries</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>tertiary level index entries</primary></indexterm>
This index term has two levels, <sgmltag>primary</sgmltag> and
<sgmltag>secondary</sgmltag>.  They correspond to an increasing amount
of indented text in the resultant index. DocBook allows for three
levels of index terms, with the third labeled
<sgmltag>tertiary</sgmltag>.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>starting index terms (ranges)</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>ending index terms (ranges)</primary></indexterm>

There are two ways that you can index a range of text. The first is to
put index marks at both the beginning and end of the discussion.  The
mark at the beginning asserts that it is the start of a range, and the
mark at the end refers back to the beginning. In this way, the
processing application can determine what range of text is
indexed. Here's the previous tiger example recast as starting and
ending index terms:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;para>
The tiger&lt;indexterm id="tiger-desc" class="startofrange">
&lt;primary>Big Cats&lt;/primary>
&lt;secondary>Tigers&lt;/secondary>&lt;/indexterm>
is a very large cat indeed&hellip;
&lt;/para>
&vellip;
&lt;para>
So much for tigers&lt;indexterm startref="tiger-desc" class="endofrange">. Let's talk about
leopards.  
&lt;/para>
</screen>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>ID attribute</primary>
  <secondary>index entries, ranges</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Class attribute</primary>
  <secondary>index entries, ranges</secondary></indexterm>

Note that the mark at the start of the range identifies itself as the
start of a range with the <sgmltag class="attribute">Class</sgmltag>
attribute, and provides an <sgmltag class="attribute">ID</sgmltag>.
The mark at the end of the range points back to the start.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>IndexTerm element</primary>
  <secondary>Zone attribute</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Zone attribute (indexterm)</primary></indexterm>

Another way to mark up a range of text is to specify that the entire
content of an element, such as a chapter or section, is the complete
range.  In this case, all you need is for the index term to point to
the <sgmltag class="attribute">ID</sgmltag> of the element that
contains the content in question. The <sgmltag class="attribute">Zone</sgmltag> attribute of <sgmltag>indexterm</sgmltag>
provides this functionality.
</para>
<para>
One of the interesting features of this method is that the actual
index marks do not have to occur anywhere near the text being
indexed. It is possible to collect all of them together, for example,
in one file, but it is not invalid to have the index marker occur near
the element it indexes.
</para>
<para>
Suppose the discussion of tigers in your document comprises a
whole text object (like a <sgmltag class="element">Sect1</sgmltag>
or a <sgmltag class="element">Chapter</sgmltag>) with an
<sgmltag class="attribute">ID</sgmltag> value of 
<literal>tiger-desc</literal>. You can put the following
tag anywhere in your document to index that range of text:
<screen>
&lt;indexterm zone="tiger-desc">
&lt;primary>Big Cats&lt;/primary>
&lt;secondary>Tigers&lt;/secondary>&lt;/indexterm>
</screen> 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>see and see also index entries</primary></indexterm>
DocBook also contains markup for index hits that point to other index
hits (of the same type such as "See Cats, big" or "See also
Lions"). See the reference pages for <sgmltag>See</sgmltag> and
<sgmltag>SeeAlso</sgmltag>.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>Printing an index</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>indexes</primary>
  <secondary>printing</secondary></indexterm>

After you have added the appropriate markup to your document, an
external application can use this information to build an index. The
resulting index must have information about the page numbers on which
the concepts appear. It's usually the document formatter that builds
the index.  In this case, it may never be instantiated in DocBook.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>indexes</primary>
  <secondary>index marked up in DocBook (example)</secondary></indexterm>

However, there are applications that can produce an index marked up in
DocBook.  The following example includes some one- and two-level
<sgmltag class="element">IndexEntry</sgmltag> elements (which
correspond to the primary and secondary levels in the
<sgmltag>indexterm</sgmltag>s themselves) that begin with the letter D:
<screen>
&lt;!DOCTYPE index PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN">
&lt;index>&lt;title>Index&lt;/title>
&lt;indexdiv>&lt;title>D&lt;/title>
&lt;indexentry>
  &lt;primaryie>database (bibliographic), 253, 255&lt;/primaryie>
     &lt;secondaryie>structure, 255&lt;/secondaryie>
     &lt;secondaryie>tools, 259&lt;/secondaryie>
&lt;/indexentry>
&lt;indexentry>

<sect2><title>Making a Glossary</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>glossaries</primary>
  <secondary>creating</secondary></indexterm>

<sgmltag>Glossary</sgmltag>s, like <sgmltag>Bibliography</sgmltag>s, are often
constructed by hand.  However, some applications are capable of
building a skeletal index from glossary term markup in the document.
If all of your terms are defined in some glossary database, it may
even be possible to construct the complete glossary automatically.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>markup</primary>
  <secondary>glossaries</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>GlossTerm element</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>LinkEnd attribute</primary>
  <secondary>GlossTerm tag</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>ID attribute</primary>
  <secondary>glossary entries</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>links</primary>
  <secondary>glossary terms (text) to glossary entries</secondary></indexterm>

To enable automatic glossary generation, or simply automatic linking
from glossary terms in the text to glossary entries, you must add
markup to your documents.  In the text, you markup a term for
compilation later with the inline <sgmltag>GlossTerm</sgmltag>
tag. This tag can have a <sgmltag class="attribute">LinkEnd</sgmltag>
attribute whose value is the ID of the actual entry in the
glossary.<footnote>
<para>
Some sophisticated formatters might even be able to establish the link
simply by examining the content of the terms and the glossary. In that
case, the author is not required to make explicit links.
</para>
</footnote>
</para>
<para>
For instance, if you have this markup in your document:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;glossterm linkend="xml">Extensible Markup Language&lt;/glossterm> is a new standard&hellip; 
</screen>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>glossaries</primary>
  <secondary>example</secondary></indexterm>

your glossary might look like this:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;!DOCTYPE glossary PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN">
&lt;glossary>&lt;title>Example Glossary&lt;/title>
&vellip;
&lt;glossdiv>&lt;title>E&lt;/title>

&lt;glossentry id="xml">&lt;glossterm>Extensible Markup Language&lt;/glossterm>
  &lt;acronym>XML&lt;/acronym>
&lt;glossdef>
  &lt;para>Some reasonable definition here.&lt;/para>
  &lt;glossseealso otherterm="sgml">
&lt;/glossdef>
&lt;/glossentry>

&lt;/glossdiv>
</screen>
<para>
Note that the <sgmltag class="element">GlossTerm</sgmltag> tag
reappears in the glossary to mark up the term and distinguish it from
its definition within the <sgmltag class="element">
GlossEntry</sgmltag>. The <sgmltag class="attribute">ID</sgmltag> that
the <sgmltag class="element"> GlossEntry</sgmltag> referenced in the
text is the <acronym>ID</acronym> of the <sgmltag class="element">GlossEntry</sgmltag> in the <sgmltag>Glossary</sgmltag>
itself. You can use the link between source and glossary to create a
link in the online form of your document, as we have done with the
online form of the glossary in this book.

<sect2><title>Making a Bibliography</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>bibliographies, creating</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>raw data</primary>
  <secondary>bibliographies</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>cooked data</primary>
  <secondary>bibliographies</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>BiblioEntry element</primary></indexterm>

There are two ways to set up a bibliography in DocBook: you can have
the data <emphasis>raw</emphasis> or
<emphasis>cooked</emphasis>. Here's an example of a raw
bibliographical item, wrapped in the <sgmltag class="element">Biblioentry</sgmltag> element:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;biblioentry xreflabel="Kites75">
  &lt;authorgroup>
    &lt;author>&lt;firstname>Andrea&lt;/firstname>&lt;surname>Bahadur&lt;/surname>&lt;/author>
    &lt;author>&lt;firstname>Mark&lt;/>&lt;surname>Shwarek&lt;/>&lt;/author>
  &lt;/authorgroup>
  &lt;copyright>&lt;year>1974&lt;/year>&lt;year>1975&lt;/year>
     &lt;holder>Product Development International Holding N. V.&lt;/holder>
     &lt;/copyright>
  &lt;isbn>0-88459-021-6&lt;/isbn>    
  &lt;publisher>
    &lt;publishername>Plenary Publications International, Inc.&lt;/publishername>
  &lt;/publisher>
  &lt;title>Kites&lt;/title>
  &lt;subtitle>Ancient Craft to Modern Sport&lt;/subtitle>
  &lt;pagenums>988-999&lt;/pagenums>
  &lt;seriesinfo>
    &lt;title>The Family Creative Workshop&lt;/title>
    &lt;seriesvolnums>1-22&lt;/seriesvolnums>
    &lt;editor>
      &lt;firstname>Allen&lt;/firstname>
      &lt;othername role=middle>Davenport&lt;/othername>
      &lt;surname>Bragdon&lt;/surname>
      &lt;contrib>Editor in Chief&lt;/contrib>
    &lt;/editor>
  &lt;/seriesinfo>
&lt;/biblioentry>
</screen>
<para>
The &ldquo;raw&rdquo; data in a <sgmltag class="element">Biblioentry</sgmltag> is comprehensive to a
fault&mdash;there are enough fields to suit a host of different
bibliographical styles, and that is the point. An abundance of data
requires processing applications to select, punctuate, order, and
format the bibliographical data, and it is unlikely that all the
information provided will actually be output.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Bibliomixed element</primary></indexterm>

All the &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; data in a <sgmltag class="element">Bibliomixed</sgmltag> entry in a bibliography, on the
other hand, is intended to be presented to the reader in the form and
sequence in which it is provided. It even includes punctuation between
the fields of data:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;bibliomixed>
  &lt;bibliomset relation=article>
    &lt;surname>Walsh&lt;/surname>, &lt;firstname>Norman&lt;/firstname>.
    &lt;title role=article>Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets&lt;/title>.
  &lt;/bibliomset>
  &lt;bibliomset relation=journal>
    &lt;title>The World Wide Web Journal&lt;/title> 
    &lt;volumenum>2&lt;/volumenum>&lt;issuenum>1&lt;/issuenum>.
    &lt;publishername>O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;/publishername> and
    &lt;corpname>The World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/corpname>.
    &lt;pubdate>Winter, 1996&lt;/pubdate>&lt;/bibliomset>.
&lt;/bibliomixed>
</screen>
<para>
Clearly, these two ways of marking up bibliographical entries are
suited to different circumstances.  You should use one or the other
for your bibliography, not both. Strictly speaking, mingling the raw
and the cooked may be &ldquo;kosher&rdquo; as far as the &DTD; is
concerned, but it will almost certainly cause problems for most
processing applications.
