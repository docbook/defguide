For the applications you have in mind, DocBook &ldquo;out of the
box&rdquo; may not be exactly what you need. Perhaps you need
additional inline elements or perhaps you want to remove elements that
you never want your authors to use. By design, DocBook makes this sort
of customization easy.

<indexterm><primary>environment</primary>
  <secondary>DocBook extensions, affecting</secondary></indexterm>

You can use customization layers to extend DocBook or subset
it. Creating a &DTD; that is a strict subset of DocBook means that all
of your instances are still completely valid DocBook instances, which
may be important to your tools and stylesheets, and to other people
with whom you share documents.  An <firstterm>extension</firstterm> adds new
structures, or changes the &DTD; in a way that is not compatible with
DocBook. Extensions can be very useful, but might have a great impact
on your environment.
</para>
<para>
Customization layers can be as small as restricting an attribute value
or as large as adding an entirely different hierarchy on top of the
inline elements.
</para>
<sect1 id="ch05-shouldi"><title>Should You Do This?</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>stylesheets</primary>
  <secondary>DTD extension, effects</secondary></indexterm>

Changing a &DTD; can have a wide-ranging impact on the tools and
stylesheets that you use. It can have an impact on your authors and on
your legacy documents.  This is especially true if you make an
extension. If you rely on your support staff to install and maintain
your authoring and publishing tools, check with them before you invest
a lot of time modifying the &DTD;. There may be additional issues that
are outside your immediate control. Proceed with caution.
</para>
<para>
That said, DocBook is designed to be easy to modify. This chapter
assumes that you are comfortable with &SGML;/&XML; &DTD; syntax, but
the examples presented should be a good springboard to learning the
syntax if it's not already familiar to you.

  <tertiary>altering</tertiary>
</indexterm>The DocBook &DTD; is usually referenced by its public identifier:
</para>
<screen>  -//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN</screen>
<para>
Previous versions of DocBook, V3.0 and the V2 variants, used the owner
identifier Davenport, rather than OASIS.
</para>
<para>
If you make any changes to the structure of the &DTD;, it is
imperative that you alter the public identifier that you use for the
&DTD; and the modules you changed.  The license agreement under which
DocBook is distributed gives you complete freedom to change, modify,
reuse, and generally hack the &DTD; in any way you want, except that
you must not call your alterations <quote>DocBook.</quote>
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>owner-identifiers</primary>
  <secondary>changing (DocBook customization)</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>description, changing (DocBook customization)</primary></indexterm>

You should change both the owner identifier and the description. The
original DocBook formal public identifiers use the following syntax:
<screen>
-//OASIS//<replaceable>text-class</replaceable> DocBook <replaceable>description</replaceable> V<replaceable>version</replaceable>//EN
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Your own formal public identifiers should use the following syntax in
order to record their DocBook derivation:
<screen>
-//<replaceable>your-owner-ID</replaceable>//<replaceable>text-class</replaceable> DocBook V<replaceable>version</replaceable>-Based <optional>Subset|Extension|Variant</optional> <replaceable>your-descrip-and-version</replaceable>//<replaceable>lang</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>
<para>For example:
<screen>
-//O'Reilly//DTD DocBook V3.0-Based Subset V1.1//EN
</screen>
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>subsets (DocBook DTD)</primary></indexterm>
If your &DTD; is a proper subset, you can advertise this status by
using the <literal>Subset</literal> keyword in the description. If
your &DTD; contains any markup model extensions, you can advertise
this status by using the <literal>Extension</literal> keyword. If
you'd rather not characterize your variant specifically as a subset or
an extension, you can leave out this field entirely, or, if you
prefer, use the <literal>Variant</literal> keyword.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>dbgenent.mod file</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>public identifiers</primary>
  <secondary>dbgenent.mod file, changing</secondary></indexterm>

There is only one file that you may change without changing the public
identifier: <filename>dbgenent.mod</filename>. And you can add only
entity and notation declarations to that file. (You can add anything
you want, naturally, but if you add anything other than entity and
notation declarations, you must change the public identifier!)

  <secondary>SGML and XML DTDs</secondary></indexterm>

&SGML; and &XML; &DTD;s are really just collections of
declarations. These declarations are stored in one or more files. A
complete &DTD; is formed by combining these files together
logically. Parameter entities are used for this purpose. Consider the
following fragment:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;!ENTITY % dbpool SYSTEM "dbpool.mod"> <co id="cl-dbpooldcl"/>
&lt;!ENTITY % dbhier SYSTEM "dbhier.mod"> <co id="cl-dbhierdcl"/>
%dbpool;                               <co id="cl-dbpooluse"/>

</screen>
<calloutlist>
<callout arearefs="cl-dbpooldcl"><para>This line declares the
parameter entity <literal>dbpool</literal> and associates it with the

</callout>
<callout arearefs="cl-dbhierdcl"><para>This line declares the
parameter entity <literal>dbhier</literal> and associates it with the

<callout arearefs="cl-dbpooluse"><para>This line references <literal>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>parsing</primary>
  <secondary>DTDs, entity declarations (repeated)</secondary></indexterm>

It is an important feature of &DTD; parsing that entity
declarations can be repeated. If an entity is declared more than once,
then the <emphasis> first</emphasis> declaration is used. Given this
fragment:
</para>
<screen>
&lt;!ENTITY foo "Lenny">
&lt;!ENTITY foo "Norm">
</screen>
<para>
The replacement text for <sgmltag class="genentity">foo</sgmltag> is
&ldquo;Lenny.&rdquo;

<para>
<indexterm><primary>modules</primary>
  <secondary>DTDs, customizing</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>parameter entities</primary>
  <secondary>DTD modules, referencing</secondary></indexterm>

These two notions, that you can break a &DTD; into modules referenced
with parameter entities and that the first entity declaration is the
one that counts, are used to build &ldquo;customization layers.&rdquo;
With customization layers you can write a &DTD; that references some
or all of DocBook, but adds your own modifications. Modifying the
&DTD; this way means that you never have to edit the DocBook modules
directly, which is a tremendous boon to maintaining your modules. When
the next release of DocBook comes out, you usually only have to make
changes to your customization layer and your modification will be back
in sync with the new version.
</para>
<para>
Customization layers work particularly well in DocBook because the
base &DTD; makes extensive use of parameter entities that can be
redefined.
</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="s-dbstruct"><title>Understanding DocBook Structure</title>
<para>
DocBook is a large and, at first glance, fairly complex &DTD;. Much of
the apparent complexity is caused by the prolific use of parameter
entities.  This was an intentional choice on the part of the
maintainers, who traded <quote>raw readability</quote> for customizability.
This section provides a general overview of the structure of the
&DTD;. After you understand it, DocBook will probably seem much less
complicated.

The &CALS; Table Model. &CALS; is an initiative by the United
States Department of Defense to standardize the document types used
across branches of the military. The &CALS; table model, published in
<acronym>MIL-HDBK-28001</acronym>, was for a long time the most widely
supported &SGML; table model (one might now argue that the &HTML;
table model is more widely supported by some definitions of
&ldquo;widely supported&rdquo;). In any event, it is the table model
used by DocBook.

<indexterm><primary>parameter entities</primary>
  <secondary>customization layers</secondary></indexterm>

Customization layers are possible because DocBook has been extensively
parameterized so that it is possible to make any changes that might be
desired without ever editing the actual distributed modules. The
parameter entities come in several flavors:
</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><sgmltag class="paramentity">*.class</sgmltag></term>
<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary sortas="class parameter entities">*.class parameter entities</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>classes</primary>
  <secondary>elements</secondary></indexterm>

Classes group elements of a similar type: for example all the
lists are in the <sgmltag class="paramentity">list.class</sgmltag>.
</para>
<para>If you want to add a new kind of something (a new kind of list
or a new kind of verbatim environment, for example), you generally
want to add the name of the new element to the appropriate class.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<indexterm><primary sortas="mix mixture classes">.mix parameter entities</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>classes</primary>
  <secondary>mixtures</secondary></indexterm>

Mixtures are collections of classes that appear in content
models. For example, the content model of the
<sgmltag>Example</sgmltag> element includes <sgmltag class="paramentity">example.mix</sgmltag>. Not every element's content
model is a single mixture, but elements in the same class tend to have
the same mixture in their content model.
</para>
<para>If you want to change the content model of some class of
elements (lists or admonitions, perhaps), you generally want to change
the definition of the appropriate mixture.

The <sgmltag class="paramentity">*.module</sgmltag> parameter
entities control <link linkend="s-ms">marked sections</link> around
individual elements and their attribute lists.  For example, the

within a marked section delimited by <sgmltag class="paramentity">abbrev.module</sgmltag>.

If you want to remove or redefine an element or its attribute

your customization layer.

include each of the modules separately, perhaps with entity or element

or attribute, remove one, or change some other aspect of the &DTD;.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>inline elements</primary>
  <secondary>adding</secondary></indexterm>

Adding an element, particularly an inline element, is one possibility.
If you're writing documentation about an object-oriented system, you
may have noticed that DocBook provides <sgmltag>ClassName</sgmltag> but not
<sgmltag>MethodName</sgmltag>. Suppose you want to add
<sgmltag>MethodName</sgmltag>?

Figuring out what to change may be the hardest part of the process.
The organization of the parameter entities is quite logical, and,
bearing in mind the organization described in <xref linkend="s-dbstruct"/>,&rdquo; finding something similar usually
provides a good model for new changes.

Two online resources may be useful. First, the 
<link linkend="ref-parement">parameter entity reference section</link> of the
online book provides more detail than the print version. Second, there
is an alternate version of the book online that shows all of the element
content models in terms of the parameter entities that define them, 
rather than the <quote>flattened</quote> versions shown here.

One resource that may be useful is the alternate version of this
book that shows all of the element content models in
terms of the parameter entities which define them, rather than
the <quote>flattened</quote> versions shown here. The alternate version
is on the <acronym>CD-ROM</acronym> and online at the book web site:

<para>
<sgmltag>MethodName</sgmltag> is similar to <sgmltag>ClassName</sgmltag>, so
<sgmltag>ClassName</sgmltag> is probably a good model.  <sgmltag>ClassName</sgmltag>
is an inline element, not a hierarchy element, so it's in
<filename>dbpool.mod</filename>. Searching for <quote>classname</quote> in
<filename>dbpool.mod</filename> reveals:

It would seem (and, in fact, it is the case) that adding
<sgmltag>MethodName</sgmltag> can be accomplished by adding it to the local
extension mechanism for <sgmltag class="paramentity">tech.char.class</sgmltag>, namely <sgmltag class="paramentity">local.tech.char.class</sgmltag>, and adding element and
attribute declarations for it. A customization layer that does this
can be seen in <xref linkend="ex-addmethodname"/>.

  <secondary>customization layers</secondary></indexterm>

&DTD;s, by their nature, contain many complex, interrelated elements.
Whenever you make a change to the &DTD;, it's always wise to use a
validating parser to double-check your work. A parser like
<command>nsgmls</command> from James Clark's
<application><acronym>SP</acronym></application> can identify elements
(attributes, parameter entities) that are declared but unused, as well
as ones that are used but undeclared.
</para>
<para>

A comprehensive test can be accomplished with
<command>nsgmls</command> using the <option>-wall</option>
option. Create a simple test document and run:
</para>

<indexterm><primary>suppressing output (parser)</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>versions</primary>
  <secondary>nsgmls parser, printing number</secondary></indexterm>

The <option>-s</option> option
tells <command>nsgmls</command> to suppress its normal output (it will
still show errors, if there are any). The <option>-v</option> option
tells <command>nsgmls</command> to print its version number; this
ensures that you always get <emphasis>some</emphasis> output, even if
there are no errors.</para>

  <secondary>warning types</secondary></indexterm>

The <option>-wall</option>
option tells <command>nsgmls</command> to provide a comprehensive list
of all errors and warnings.  You can use less verbose, and more
specific options instead; for example, <option>-wundefined</option> to
flag undefined elements or <option>-wunused-param</option> to warn you
about unused parameter entities. The <command>nsgmls</command>
documentation provides a complete list of warning types.</para>

<para>

If you run the preceding command over DocBook <acronym>V3.1</acronym>,
you'll discover one warning generated by the &DTD;:

</screen>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Entry element</primary></indexterm>

This is not truly an error in the &DTD;, and can safely be ignored.
The warning is caused by <quote>pernicious mixed content</quote> in
the content model of DocBook's <sgmltag>Entry</sgmltag> element.  See
the <sgmltag>Entry</sgmltag> reference page for a complete discussion.

DocBook contains a large number of computer inlines. The DocBook
inlines define a domain-specific vocabulary.  If you're working in
another domain, many of them may be unnecessary. You can remove a
bunch of them by redefining the <sgmltag class="paramentity">tech.char.class</sgmltag> parameter entity and
then excluding the declarations for the elements removed. The initial
definition of <sgmltag class="paramentity">tech.char.class</sgmltag> is:

&lt;!ENTITY % tech.char.class

described in <xref linkend="cust.test"/>,&rdquo; we discovered that
these elements are used in other content models.  Because they are
used in other content modules, they cannot simply be removed from the
&DTD; by deleting them from <sgmltag class="paramentity">

outright, we've taken them out of most inline contexts.

It's likely that a customization layer that removed this many

<xref linkend="ex.remvadmon.3"/> uses numeric character entity
references to escape the <literal>%</literal> signs in the entity
declarations and nests an entity declaration in another parameter
entity. All of this is perfectly legal, but a bit confusing.  A
clearer solution, and the only practical solution if you're doing
anything more than a single redeclaration, is to place the new
declarations in another file and include them in your customization
layer by reference, like this:

Perhaps the modification that you want to make is to completely remove
an entire class of elements. (If you have no need for synopsis
elements of any sort, why not remove them?) In order to remove an
entire class of elements, you must not only redefine the class as
empty, but you must also redefine all of the parameter entities that
use that class. The customization layer below completely removes the
<sgmltag class="paramentity"> synop.class</sgmltag> from DocBook. It
requires a customization layer, shown in <xref linkend="ex.remvclass"/>, that includes both a redeclaration module in
<filename>dbpool.mod</filename> and a redeclaration module in
