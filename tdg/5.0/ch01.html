It began in 1991 as a
    joint project of HaL Computer Systems and O’Reilly &amp; Associates (as
    O’Reilly Media, Inc. was then called). Its popularity grew, and eventually
    it spawned its own maintenance organization, the Davenport
    Group.<a class="indexterm" name="idx.davenport"></a> In mid-1998, maintenance moved to a Technical Committee of
    the <span class="keep-together">Organization</span> for the Advancement
    of Structured Information Standards (<span class="acronym">OASIS</span>).<a class="indexterm" name="s.shorthistory.2.6"></a><a class="indexterm" name="s.shorthistory.2.7"></a></p><p>DocBook’s roots are in <em class="firstterm"><a href="dbgloss.html#gloss-sgml">SGML</a></em>, where it was defined with a
    Document Type Definition, or <span class="acronym">DTD</span>. DocBook was released
    as both an <span class="acronym">SGML</span> and an <em class="firstterm"><a href="dbgloss.html#gloss-xml"><span class="acronym">XML</span></a></em> vocabulary starting
    with <span class="acronym">V4.1</span>. The <span class="acronym">V4.x</span> versions of
    DocBook, like the versions that came before them, were also defined with a
    <span class="acronym">DTD</span>. Starting with DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>,
    DocBook is exclusively an <span class="acronym">XML</span> vocabulary defined with
    RELAX NG and Schematron.</p><section id="s.history.haloreilly" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h4>1.1. The HaL and O’Reilly Era</h4></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="s.history.haloreilly.2.1"></a><a class="indexterm" name="s.history.haloreilly.2.2"></a><a class="indexterm" name="s.history.haloreilly.2.3"></a>The DocBook <span class="acronym">DTD</span> was originally designed
      and implemented by HaL Computer Systems and O’Reilly &amp; Associates
      around 1991. It was developed primarily to facilitate the exchange of
      <span class="acronym">UNIX</span> documentation originally marked up in
      <strong class="command">troff</strong>. Its design appears to have been based partly
      on input from <span class="acronym">SGML</span> interchange projects conducted by
      the Unix International and Open Software Foundation consortia.</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="s.history.haloreilly.3.1"></a>When DocBook <span class="acronym">V1.1</span> was published,
      discussion about its revision and maintenance began in earnest in the
      Davenport Group, a forum created by O’Reilly for computer documentation
      producers. DocBook <span class="acronym">V1.2</span> was influenced strongly by
      Novell and <span class="keep-together">Digital</span>.</p><p>In 1994, the Davenport Group became an officially chartered entity
      responsible <span class="keep-together">for DocBook’s</span>
      maintenance. DocBook <span class="acronym">V1.2.2</span> was published
      simultaneously. The <span class="keep-together">founding</span>
      sponsors of this incarnation of Davenport include the following people
      with their affiliations at that time:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li>Jon Bosak, Novell</li><li>Dale Dougherty, O’Reilly &amp; Associates</li><li>Ralph Ferris, Fujitsu <span class="acronym">OSSI</span></li><li>Dave Hollander, Hewlett-Packard</li><li>Eve Maler, Digital Equipment Corporation</li><li>Murray Maloney, <span class="acronym">SCO</span></li><li>Conleth O’Connell, HaL Computer Systems</li><li>Nancy Paisner, Hitachi Computer Products</li><li>Mike Rogers, SunSoft</li><li>Jean Tappan, Unisys</li></ul></div></section><section id="s.history.davenport" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h4>1.2. The Davenport Era</h4></div><p>Under the auspices of the Davenport Group, the DocBook
      <span class="acronym">DTD</span> began to widen its scope. It was now being used
      by a much wider audience and for new purposes such as direct authoring
      with <span class="acronym">SGML</span>-aware tools and publishing directly to
      paper. As the largest users of DocBook, Novell and Sun had a heavy
      influence on its design.</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="s.history.davenport.3.1"></a>In order to help users manage change, the new Davenport
      charter established the following rules for DocBook releases:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Minor versions (“<span class="quote">point releases</span>” such as
          <span class="acronym">V2.2</span>) could add to the markup model, but could
          not change it in a backward-incompatible way. For example, a new
          kind of list element could be added, but it would not be acceptable
          for the existing itemized list model to start requiring two list
          items inside it instead of only one. Thus, any document conforming
          to version <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>.0 would also conform to
          <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>.<em class="replaceable"><code>m</code></em>.</p></li><li><p>Major versions (such as <span class="acronym">V3.0</span>) could both
          add to the markup model and make backward-incompatible changes.
          However, the changes would have to be <span class="keep-together">announced</span> in the last major
          release.</p><p>In 2009, the Technical Committee updated this policy to allow
          <span class="keep-together">backward-</span><span class="keep-together">incompatible</span> changes in a major
          version, provided the change is announced in a major or minor
          release at least six months in advance.</p></li><li><p>Major version introductions must be separated by at least a
          year.</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="s.history.davenport.5.1"></a><span class="acronym">V3.0</span> was released in January 1997.
      DocBook’s audience continued to grow, but many of the Davenport Group
      stalwarts became involved in the <span class="acronym">XML</span> effort, and
      development slowed dramatically. The idea of creating an official
      <span class="acronym">XML</span>-compliant version of DocBook was discussed, but
      not implemented at that time.</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="s.history.davenport.6.1"></a>In July 1998, the sponsors moved the standards activities
      from the Davenport Group to <span class="acronym">OASIS</span>, forming the
      <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> DocBook Technical Committee with Eduardo
      Gutentag of Sun Microsystems as chair.</p></section><section id="s.history.oasis" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h4>1.3. The <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> Era</h4></div><p>The <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">DocBook Technical
      Committee</a> is continuing the work started by the Davenport Group.
      The transition from Davenport to <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> was very
      smooth, in part because the core team remained essentially the
      same.</p><p>DocBook <span class="acronym">V3.1</span>, published in February 1999, was
      the first <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> release. It integrated a number of
      changes that had been “<span class="quote">in the wings</span>” for some time. In
      March 2000, Norm Walsh became chair of the Technical Committee.
      <div class="remark">Norm: is this date correct?</div></p><p>In February 2001, <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> made DocBook
      <span class="acronym">SGML</span> <span class="acronym">V4.1</span> and DocBook

      <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> Specifications</a>.</p><p>In October 2005, the DocBook Technical Committee released the
      first beta test version of DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>. Development
      of the DocBook <span class="acronym">4.x</span> series continued in parallel with
      the development of <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>. In October 2006, the DocBook
      Technical Committee released DocBook <span class="acronym">V4.5</span>, the last
      release planned in the <span class="acronym">4.x</span> series.</p><p>In 2008, the Publisher’s Subcommittee was chartered to develop and
      maintain official variants of DocBook in support of the publishing
      industry. The subcommittee focuses on schema customizations to support:
      periodicals as regularly published technical notes or journals, book
      publishing (such as business, legal, medical, and other nontechnical
      domains), educational textbooks, and other document types as appropriate
      for this industry.</p><p>DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> became an official Committee
      Specification in June 2009 and became an official
      <span class="acronym">OASIS</span> Standard in October 2009. <div class="remark">Date may need
      to change if voting is delayed</div> The Technical Committee
      continues DocBook development to ensure that the schema will continue to

    <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> are quite radical in some aspects, but the basic
    idea behind DocBook is still the same, and almost all element names are
    unchanged. Because of this it is very easy to become familiar with DocBook
    <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> if you know any previous version of
    DocBook.</p><section id="introduction-whats-new" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h4>2.1. What’s New in DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>?</h4></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="WhatsNewStart"></a>In <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>, DocBook has been rewritten as
      a native RELAX NG grammar (“<span class="quote"><em class="citetitle">An

      [<a href="appc.html#RNG-Intro"><span class="abbrev">RNG-Intro</span></a>] is an excellent introduction to the
      grammar). The objectives were to produce a schema that:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol style="list-style: decimal;"><li><p>“<span class="quote">Feels like</span>” DocBook. Most existing documents
          should still be valid or it should be possible to transform them in

          additional constraints are expressed with Schematron rules.</p></li><li><p>Cleans up the content models.</p></li><li><p>Gives users the flexibility to extend or subset the schema in
          an easy and straightforward way.</p></li><li><p>Can be used to generate <span class="acronym">XML</span> DTD and W3C

      <span class="keep-together">backward-</span><span class="keep-together">incompatible</span> changes that could be made in
      DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> were those announced in DocBook
      <span class="acronym">V4.0.</span> In light of the fact that this is a complete
      rewrite, the Technical Committee gave itself the freedom to make
      “<span class="quote">unannounced</span>” backward-incompatible changes for this one

broad context, DocBook is often customized to satisfy the requirements
of specific organizations or projects. The DocBook Technical Committee encourages such
customization and works hard to make sure that the schemas are as
amenable to customization as possible.</p><p>When customizers add new elements to DocBook, they often place those
elements in the DocBook namespace.
There is historical precedent for this approach as DocBook's history
pre-dates namespaces and even XML. Even without precedent, users would
almost certainly encourage customizers to use the same namespace. In
many cases it simplifies authoring and almost always simplifies the
training of new authors.</p><p>However, a new element introduced into the DocBook namespace by a
local customization is not officially part of DocBook. Only the
DocBook Technical Committee can introduce new elements into DocBook officially by
publishing a new version of the standard with those elements.</p><p>This means that the practice of adding new, local elements into the DocBook
namespace comes with a cost:
the potential for confusion among authors familiar with different
customizations and the costs associated with resolving any conflicts
between interchange partners.
</p><p>The DocBook Technical Committee encourages customizers to think carefully about these
costs and weight the potential tradoffs between unofficially adding
elements to DocBook and using elements in their own namespace with
care.</p></section></section><section id="introduction-rng" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h3>4. Relaxing with DocBook</h3></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="idx.introduction-rng"></a>For more than a decade, the DocBook schema was defined using

    For your convenience there are also <span class="acronym">DTD</span> and W3C
    <span class="acronym">XML</span> Schema versions provided for DocBook
    <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>. However, neither the <span class="acronym">DTD</span> nor
    the W3C <span class="acronym">XML</span> schema can capture all the constraints of
    DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>. This means that a document that validates
    against the <span class="acronym">DTD</span> or <span class="acronym">XML</span> schema is not
    necessarily valid against the RELAX NG schema, and thus may not be a valid
    DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> document.</p><p><span class="acronym">DTD</span> and W3C <span class="acronym">XML</span> Schema
    versions of the DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> grammar are provided as a
    convenience for users who want to use DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> with
    legacy tools that don’t support RELAX NG. Authors are encouraged to switch
    to RELAX NG-based tools as soon as possible, or at least to validate
    documents against the RELAX NG schema before further processing.</p><p>Some document constraints can’t be expressed in grammar-based schema
    languages like RELAX NG or W3C <span class="acronym">XML</span> Schema. To define
    these additional constraints DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> uses
    Schematron. We recommend that you validate your document against both the
    RELAX NG and Schematron schemas.</p><section id="schemas" class="section"><div class="section-titlepage"><h4>6.1. Where to Get the Schemas</h4></div><p>The latest versions of schemas can be obtained from <code class="uri"><a href="http://docbook.org/schemas/5x.html">http://docbook.org/schemas/5x.html</a></code>.

    collection of tens of thousands of DocBook documents, one question that
    you have to consider is “<span class="quote">how stable is DocBook?</span>” Will the
    documents that you write today still be useful tomorrow, or next year, or
    in the next century?</p><p>This question may seem particularly pertinent if you’re in the
    process of converting a collection of DocBook <span class="acronym">4.x</span>
    documents to DocBook <span class="acronym">V5.0</span> because we introduced a
    number of backward-incompatible changes in <span class="acronym">V5.0</span>.</p><p>The DocBook Technical Committee understands that the community
    benefits from the long-term stability of the DocBook family of schemas. We
    also understand that DocBook must continue to adapt and change in order to
    remain relevant in a changing world.</p><p>All changes, and especially changes that are backward incompatible
    (changes that make a currently valid document no longer valid under a new
    version of the schema), have a cost associated with them. The technical
    committee must balance those costs against the need to remain responsive
    to the community’s desire to see DocBook grow to cover the new use cases
    that inevitably arise in documentation.</p><p>With that in mind, the DocBook Technical Committee has adopted the
    following policy on backward-incompatible changes. This policy spells out
    when <span class="keep-together">backward-</span><span class="keep-together">incompatible</span> changes can occur and how much
    notice the technical committee must provide before adopting a schema that
    is backward incompatible with the current <span class="keep-together">release</span>.</p><p>This policy allows DocBook to continue to change and adapt while
    simultaneously guaranteeing that existing users will have sufficient
    advance notice to develop reasonable migration plans.</p><p>With respect to schema changes, the technical committee asserts that
    the following points will always apply:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>A point release (X.1 to X.2, X.2 to X.3, X.1 to X.1.2, etc.)
        <em>will not</em> contain any backward-incompatible
        changes.</p></li><li><p>A major release (X.1 to Y.0, X.2 to Y.0, X.1.2 to Y.0, etc.)
        <em class="glossterm">may</em> contain backward-incompatible changes
        if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>the change was announced in the release notes for the
            previous version (major or minor) and</p></li><li><p>the change was announced in a release that occurred at least
            six months <span class="keep-together">previously</span>.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>By these rules, the technical committee can announce, in
    <span class="acronym">V5.1</span>, for example, its plans to make a
    backward-incompatible change in V6.0. Then, in V6.0, if it’s been at least
    six months since <span class="acronym">V5.1</span> was released, it can make that
    change.</p><p>As a general rule, the technical committee tries to avoid
    backward-incompatible changes.</p></section></article></div></div><div class="navfooter"><table width="100%" summary="Navigation table"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a title="Part  I .  Introduction" href="part1.html"><img src="figs/web/nav/prev.png" alt="Prev" border="0" /></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a title="DocBook 5: The Definitive Guide" href="docbook.html"><img src="figs/web/nav/home-defguide.png" alt="Home" border="0" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a title="Creating DocBook Documents" href="ch02.html"><img src="figs/web/nav/next.png" alt="Next" border="0" /></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Part  I .  Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a title="Part  I .  Introduction" href="part1.html"><img src="figs/web/nav/up.png" alt="Up" border="0" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> Creating DocBook Documents</td></tr></table></div><div class="copyrightfooter"><p><a href="dbcpyright.html">Copyright</a> © 2010, 2011 Norman Walsh.</p></div></body></html>
