>DocBook provides a system for writing structured documents using
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>. It is particularly well-suited to books and papers
about computer hardware and software, though it is by no means limited
to them.  DocBook is an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> document type definition (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>). An
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> version is available now, and an official <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> release is in
the works.  Because it is a large and robust <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>, and because its
main structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes a
book, DocBook has been adopted by a large and growing community of
authors. DocBook is supported "out of the box" by a number
of commercial tools, and support for it is rapidly growing in a number
of free software environments. In short, DocBook is an
easy-to-understand and widely used <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>. Dozens of organizations use
DocBook for millions of pages of documentation, in various print
and online formats, worldwide.</P

>1. Why Read This Book?</A
></H1
><P
>This book is designed to be the clear, concise, normative reference to
the DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>. This book is the official documentation for the
DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>We hope to answer, definitively, all the questions you might
have about all the elements and entities in DocBook.  In
particular, we cover the following subjects:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The general nature of DocBook. With over 300 elements,
DocBook can be a bit overwhelming at first. We quickly get you up to
speed on how the pieces fit together.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>How to write DocBook documents. Where should you start
and what should you do?</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Parsing and validation. After you've written a
document, how can you tell if it really conforms to the DocBook
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>?</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>How to publish DocBook documents. After you've written
one, what do you do with it? We provide a guide to using some popular
free tools to publish DocBook documents both in print and on the
Web.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Customizing the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>. Many individuals and
corporations have standardized on the DocBook <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTD</SPAN
>. Whether your
subject matter is computer software documentation or not,
we explain how you can write a "customization layer" to
tailor DocBook explicitly for your information.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Understanding all of the elements. Each element is
extensively documented, including the intended semantics and the
purpose of all its attributes. An example of proper usage is given
for every element. The parameter entities and character entities are
also described.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Stylesheets. Several standard stylesheet
languages are briefly described.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> compatability. We outline all of the points that
you'll need to consider
as you or your organization contemplate <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
> for authoring, publishing, or
both.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Additional resources and a
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CD-ROM</SPAN
>. Finally, we direct you to other places you
can go for all the latest info, and offer a complete set of online
documentation on the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CD-ROM</SPAN
>.</P

>2. This Book's Audience</A
></H1
><P
>We expect that most readers will have some familiarity with <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> or
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>. Even if your experience goes no farther than writing a few
<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>HTML</SPAN
> pages, you're probably in good shape.  Although we provide an
introduction to <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>, and structured markup, this book may
not suffice as your only tutorial about <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>XML</SPAN
>. This
depends, naturally, on your needs and experience.  For a list of some
other good resources, consult <A
HREF="appd.html"
>Appendix D, <I
>Resources</I
>,</A
>.</P
><P
>Some sections of this book describe tools and applications. For
the most part, these are Microsoft Windows or <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>UNIX</SPAN
> applications,
although there's nothing about DocBook that makes it unsuitable for the
Mac or <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VM/CMS</SPAN
> or any other operating system of your
choice.</P

members of the Davenport Group who answered all my questions so
many years ago, especially Jon Bosak, Eduardo Guttentag, and
