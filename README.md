# DocBook (4): The Definitive Guide

The first edition of _DocBook: The Definitive Guide_ described the
last DTD-based edition of DocBook, version V4.5.

The book was reorganized and rewritten for
_DocBook 5: The Definitive Guide_, producing a
new set of sources. Those are in the `master` and other branches of
this repository.

The first edition sources havenâ€™t been changed in years, and the tool
chain is unlikely to work with them.

This branch exists just to make it easy to find them. In case there
is historical interest.
