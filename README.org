#+TITLE: DocBook: The Definitive Guide

This repository contains the sources for /DocBook 5: The Definitive Guide/
and derivative works, /DocBook Publishers/, /DocBook Simplified/,
/DocBook Slides/, and /DocBook Website/.

* Builds

The DocBook schemas are compiled into “RND” files in the [[https://github.com/docbook/docbook][DocBook
schema]] repository. Those compiled schemas are combined with reference
pages and the chapters of each book to produce the published versions.

The [[https://circleci.com/gh/docbook][CircleCI]] build system compiles and publishes the books on each
commit.
